  "guideIntro": "Oudtshoorn is the capital of the Klein Karoo, famous for ostrich farming, the Cango Caves, and the majestic Route 62. This bustling town serves as the commercial centre for the entire Klein Karoo region, with a diverse economy spanning tourism, agriculture, and light industry. The extreme Karoo climate — scorching summers and cold winters — creates particular electrical demands, while the town's mix of grand Victorian feather palaces, modest workers' cottages, and modern developments means electricians here must be versatile. ProHub connects Oudtshoorn residents and businesses with verified electrical professionals.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Oudtshoorn electricians handle everything from historic building rewiring to modern commercial installations. Popular services include air conditioning electrical work (essential in Karoo summers), solar installations (the region has exceptional sunshine), geyser and heating system electrical work, DB board upgrades for older properties, three-phase installations for agricultural processing, and guesthouse and B&B electrical maintenance for the thriving tourism sector. The ostrich industry and agricultural processing facilities also create demand for industrial electrical services.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Oudtshoorn's practical Karoo culture values getting things done, but electrical work isn't the place for improvisation. The extreme temperature swings stress electrical systems in ways milder climates don't, and older properties often hide surprises behind walls. The town's active tourism industry means guest safety is paramount for accommodation owners. Use qualified electricians, keep proper documentation, and protect both your property and your guests.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Request quotes through ProHub to connect with Oudtshoorn-based electricians. The town has a healthy contractor base serving both residential and commercial clients. Response times are generally excellent. For work in outlying areas like Dysselsdorp or on surrounding farms, travel charges may apply. The town's tourism focus means electricians understand the urgency of getting guesthouses operational quickly.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Oudtshoorn offers good electrician choice. Verify registration, check ProHub reviews, and ask about experience relevant to your specific job. For historic feather palace renovations, confirm experience with heritage properties. For tourism businesses, find an electrician who provides responsive service during your busy seasons. Agricultural clients should confirm three-phase and motor experience.",
