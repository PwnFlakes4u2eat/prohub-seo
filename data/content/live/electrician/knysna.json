  "guideIntro": "Knysna's stunning location between the famous lagoon and indigenous forests makes it one of South Africa's most desirable addresses — but it also presents unique electrical challenges. The humid coastal air accelerates corrosion on electrical components, older properties around The Heads and Leisure Isle often have outdated wiring, and the town's reliance on tourism means holiday homes sit empty for months before needing urgent attention. ProHub connects Knysna residents and property owners with verified local electricians who understand these challenges and can handle everything from emergency repairs to complete solar installations.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Knysna electricians commonly deal with moisture-related electrical issues, holiday home maintenance, and the growing demand for off-grid and backup power solutions. Popular services include marine-grade DB board installations (essential for lagoon-side properties), solar and battery backup systems, geyser repairs and replacements, security system installations, and pre-holiday safety inspections for Airbnb and rental properties. Following the devastating 2017 fires, many Knysna electricians also specialise in full rewiring of rebuilt properties and fire-damage assessments.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Knysna's combination of coastal humidity and older properties makes electrical DIY particularly risky here. Salt air corrodes connections faster than inland areas, and many Leisure Isle and Heads properties have wiring from decades past. Even simple-looking jobs can reveal hidden problems. Unless you're changing a light bulb or resetting a breaker, call a professional. The cost of an electrician is nothing compared to fire damage or electrocution — and your insurance won't cover unlicensed work.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Submit your job details through ProHub and receive up to 5 quotes from verified Knysna electricians, usually within hours. For standard repairs, expect quotes via phone or message. Larger jobs like solar installations or full rewires typically require a site visit first. Knysna electricians are experienced with holiday home logistics — many can coordinate with property managers or work from photos and videos if you're not in town. Always confirm whether CoC issuance is included in the quote.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Knysna has its share of fly-by-night operators targeting tourists and absentee homeowners. Protect yourself by using ProHub's verified electricians, checking registration status, and reading local reviews. Ask specifically about experience with coastal properties and humidity-related issues. For holiday homes, find an electrician willing to be your ongoing contact for emergencies. Established Knysna electricians often have relationships with local hardware suppliers and can source parts faster than newcomers.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How much does an electrician cost in Knysna?",
      "answer": "Knysna electrician rates typically run R400-R600 per hour, slightly higher than George due to the smaller contractor pool. Callout fees average R450-R700. DB board upgrades cost R4,000-R9,000, solar installations R40,000-R130,000 depending on system size, and CoC inspections R1,500-R4,000. Peak holiday season (December-January) may see higher rates and longer wait times."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can electricians in Knysna install solar systems?",
      "answer": "Yes, several Knysna electricians are certified solar installers with PV GreenCard accreditation. Given Knysna's excellent sun exposure and frequent load shedding, solar with battery backup is increasingly popular. Request quotes specifically mentioning solar experience and ask to see previous installations in the area."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Knysna electricians service Leisure Isle and The Heads?",
      "answer": "Yes, ProHub electricians cover all Knysna areas including The Heads, Leisure Isle, Knysna Quays, Hornlee, Concordia, and surrounds. Some also service Sedgefield, Plettenberg Bay, and Noetzie. Island and remote properties may incur additional travel charges — confirm when requesting quotes."
    },
    {
      "question": "I have a holiday home in Knysna — can electricians work without me there?",
      "answer": "Many Knysna electricians are experienced with absentee owners and can coordinate access through property managers, estate agents, or trusted neighbours. Some can diagnose issues via video call before visiting. Discuss logistics when getting quotes — a good electrician will have done this many times before."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is my Knysna property tripping the breaker constantly?",
      "answer": "Constant tripping in Knysna often relates to humidity and salt air corroding connections, overloaded circuits in older properties, or faulty appliances. A qualified electrician can perform fault-finding (typically R400-R1,000) to identify the cause. Don't just keep resetting — persistent tripping indicates a problem that could become dangerous."
