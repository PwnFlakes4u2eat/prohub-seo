  "guideIntro": "Still Bay (Stilbaai) is a hidden gem on the Western Cape coast, beloved by fishing enthusiasts, surfers, and families seeking a quieter alternative to Garden Route tourist hubs. The town spans both sides of the Goukou River estuary — Still Bay East and Still Bay West — with holiday homes at Jongensfontein and Melkhoutfontein nearby. This dual-village character and strong holiday home presence creates particular electrical demands: properties that sit empty then need immediate attention, coastal corrosion issues, and a community that swells dramatically during holidays. ProHub connects Still Bay property owners with verified electricians ready to help.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Still Bay electricians specialise in holiday property maintenance and coastal residential work. Popular services include pre-holiday electrical inspections, geyser repairs (essential before visitors arrive), DB board upgrades for older cottages, solar and battery backup installations, and emergency repairs during busy holiday periods. The fishing culture means many properties have secondary structures — boat garages, braai areas, outdoor entertainment spaces — requiring electrical extensions. Marine-grade components are standard for anything near the water.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Still Bay's relaxed fishing village atmosphere might suggest casual approaches are acceptable, but electrical work demands professionalism. The coastal location accelerates corrosion on any substandard work, holiday properties sitting empty can develop issues unseen, and the town's remote location from major centres means rescue electricians aren't always immediately available. Do it right the first time with a qualified professional.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Request quotes through ProHub to connect with electricians servicing Still Bay. The town is served by local operators and contractors from Riversdale (30km) and occasionally Mossel Bay. For holiday homeowners, many electricians coordinate with property managers or neighbours for access. Response times are generally good for planned work; emergency availability during peak December-January period is limited — book ahead if possible.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Still Bay's seasonal nature means choosing an electrician who genuinely services the area regularly, not just occasionally. Check ProHub reviews from other Still Bay property owners. For holiday homes, find someone willing to be your go-to contact for pre-visit checks and emergency response. Ask about availability during your typical visiting periods.",
