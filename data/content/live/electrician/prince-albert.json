  "guideIntro": "Prince Albert is one of South Africa's best-preserved Karoo villages, a heritage gem at the foot of the Swartberg Pass that draws visitors with its Victorian architecture, legendary figs and olives, and proximity to the vast Karoo interior. This picturesque town has attracted artists, writers, and weekenders from Cape Town who've restored historic cottages alongside established farming families. The heritage character means electrical work here requires particular sensitivity, while the thriving guesthouse economy demands reliability. ProHub connects Prince Albert's discerning community with verified electricians who respect both history and modern needs.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Prince Albert electricians specialise in heritage-sensitive work alongside practical agricultural services. Popular jobs include sympathetic rewiring of Victorian cottages and Karoo-style homes, guesthouse backup power systems, DB board upgrades concealed appropriately, solar installations (excellent in the Karoo sun), and farm electrical services for surrounding properties. The village's artisanal food economy (olives, figs, preserves) also creates demand for small-scale processing facility electrical work. Quality and character preservation are valued over mere functionality.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Prince Albert's heritage properties deserve professional care from electricians who understand historic buildings. These aren't properties for casual DIY experimentation — sympathetic electrical work requires knowledge of how to conceal modern systems within period fabric. The active guesthouse and rental market also means compliance matters for guest safety. Use qualified electricians who respect the village's architectural character.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Request quotes through ProHub to connect with electricians servicing Prince Albert. The village is served by local contractors and those from Oudtshoorn (45km via Meiringspoort) or Graaff-Reinet. For heritage work, expect conversations about approaches rather than just prices — good electricians want to understand your preservation priorities. The quality-conscious local market has cultivated electricians who deliver accordingly.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Prince Albert's heritage-focused community has high standards. Ask specifically about experience with Victorian and Karoo architecture. Request examples of previous work in historic properties. For guesthouses, find an electrician who provides responsive service during your busy seasons. The village's small size means reputation matters enormously — ask locally who delivers quality work.",

    {
