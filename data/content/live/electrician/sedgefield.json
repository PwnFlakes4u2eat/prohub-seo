  "guideIntro": "Sedgefield proudly holds 'Slow Town' status — but that doesn't mean you want to wait around for electrical problems to fix themselves. This peaceful village between George and Knysna has grown from a quiet retirement spot into a vibrant community with the famous Wild Oats Market, excellent restaurants, and increasingly sophisticated homes. Whether you're a long-time resident in the village, have a holiday cottage at Cola Beach, or run a guesthouse needing reliable power, ProHub connects you with verified electricians who service the Sedgefield area.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Sedgefield electricians handle the full range of residential services with particular expertise in the area's housing mix. Popular services include solar installations (the eco-conscious Sedgefield community has embraced renewable energy enthusiastically), geyser repairs and solar geyser conversions, DB board upgrades for older village properties, prepaid meter installations, and small business electrical work for the town's growing hospitality sector. The lagoon-side location means moisture-resistant installations are important for longevity.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Sedgefield's relaxed atmosphere might tempt you toward DIY solutions, but electrical work isn't the place for self-reliance. The village's mix of older cottages and newer builds means hidden electrical surprises are common. Coastal humidity affects wiring faster than you'd expect. More practically, selling property in Sedgefield requires a valid CoC, and the discerning buyers attracted to this area will notice substandard work. Keep the slow town ethos — let a professional handle the electrics while you enjoy a coffee at the market.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Being a smaller town, Sedgefield is primarily serviced by electricians based in George and Knysna, with some local operators. Response times through ProHub are generally good — electricians know the Sedgefield market and service it regularly. For emergencies, same-day callouts are usually possible. The town's size means electricians often know the properties and their quirks, which can speed up diagnosis and repair.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "With fewer locally-based electricians, Sedgefield residents should verify that quoted contractors actually service the area regularly — not just occasionally. Check ProHub reviews from other Sedgefield customers specifically. Ask about typical response times to the village. For ongoing relationships (holiday home maintenance, rental property support), find an electrician who treats Sedgefield as part of their regular territory rather than a distant callout.",

ProHub matches you with verified electricians who actively service Sedgefield regardless of their base location. Response times are generally excellent due to the central Garden Route position."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get solar installed at my Sedgefield holiday home?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Solar is popular in Sedgefield, both for environmental reasons and practical load shedding resilience. Holiday homes benefit from systems sized for occasional high usage.

    },
    {
      "question": "Do Sedgefield electricians cover Cola Beach and Myoli Beach?",
      "answer": "Yes, ProHub electricians service all Sedgefield areas including the village centre, Cola Beach, Myoli Beach, Swartvlei, and surrounding smallholdings. Some also cover nearby Wilderness and the road toward Knysna."
    },
    {
      "question": "My Sedgefield cottage has old wiring — what should I do?",
      "answer": "Older Sedgefield properties often have wiring that predates modern safety standards. Get a CoC inspection to assess the situation — the electrician will identify what's compliant and what needs upgrading. Full rewiring isn't always necessary; targeted upgrades to DB boards and earth leakage protection often suffice."
