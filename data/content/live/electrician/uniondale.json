  "guideIntro": "Uniondale is a historic farming town where the Klein Karoo meets the Garden Route interior, positioned at the junction of roads to George, Knysna, Oudtshoorn, and the Eastern Cape. This strategic location has made it a service centre for surrounding farms since the 1800s. Today, the town maintains its agricultural character while attracting travellers on the quieter route between coast and Karoo. Electrical needs here are practical: farming operations, established town properties, and the occasional tourism venture. ProHub connects Uniondale's straightforward community with verified electricians who deliver reliable service.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Uniondale electricians focus on agricultural and practical residential work. Popular services include farm electrical installations (irrigation, livestock facilities, workshops), borehole and pump systems, three-phase connections for farming equipment, DB board upgrades for older town properties, solar installations for energy independence, and general residential repairs. The farming economy drives most demand, with reliability valued over sophistication.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Uniondale farmers are self-reliant by necessity, but electrical work remains professional territory for good reasons. Farm installations involve higher hazards than residential work, compliance matters for insurance claims, and mistakes in remote locations are costly to fix. The town's distance from major centres makes getting emergency help slower. Invest in proper professional work the first time.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Request quotes through ProHub to connect with electricians servicing Uniondale. The town is served by local contractors and those travelling from George (70km via the Prince Alfred Pass) or Oudtshoorn (90km). Distance affects callout fees and response times. For farm work, expect practical assessments and straightforward quotes without unnecessary complexity.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "In Uniondale, reliability and agricultural experience matter most. Ask about specific experience with farm electrical systems. Check how the electrician handles the distance — are they willing to service Uniondale regularly or is it an inconvenient exception? Local recommendations carry significant weight in this close community.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How much does an electrician cost in Uniondale?",
      "answer": "Uniondale electrician rates typically run R280-R450 per hour. Callout fees vary significantly based on contractor location — expect R400-R800 depending on travel distance. Farm work is typically quoted per job rather than hourly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do George electricians come to Uniondale?",
      "answer": "Some George electricians service Uniondale via the Prince Alfred Pass (70km, roughly 1.5 hours). Travel charges apply, but the route is scenic and regularly travelled. Confirm Uniondale service when requesting quotes from George-based contractors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get solar installed on my Uniondale farm?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. The area has excellent solar potential with clear Karoo skies. Farm installations can offset significant electricity costs for irrigation and operations. Large roof areas and open land make bigger systems practical. Costs range from R50,000 for basic systems to R300,000+ for large agricultural installations."
    },
    {
      "question": "My farm is remote — how does emergency service work?",
      "answer": "Honestly assess response times for remote properties — same-day service may not be possible. Build a relationship with an electrician who knows your property, maintain backup systems where practical, and address issues proactively rather than waiting for emergencies."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can I get an electrician in Uniondale?",
      "answer": "Planned work can typically be scheduled within 5-10 days depending on contractor availability. Emergency response depends on where the nearest available electrician is located. The town's remote position means planning ahead is preferable to urgent callouts."
