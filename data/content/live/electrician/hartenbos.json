  "guideIntro": "Hartenbos is the Garden Route's favourite family beach destination, with golden sand beaches, safe swimming, and a laid-back holiday atmosphere. Adjacent to Mossel Bay, this popular resort town sees its population multiply during school holidays as families flock to their beach cottages and holiday flats. This seasonal pattern creates unique electrical demands — properties sit empty for months then need everything working perfectly when the family arrives. ProHub connects Hartenbos property owners with verified electricians who understand holiday home maintenance and can provide reliable pre-season checks.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Hartenbos electricians specialise in holiday property maintenance alongside standard residential services. Popular work includes pre-holiday inspections and repairs, geyser element replacements (nothing ruins a holiday like cold water), DB board upgrades for older beach cottages, solar and backup power installations, prepaid meter systems for rental properties, and emergency repairs during the busy December-January period. The coastal location means electricians here are experienced with salt air corrosion and moisture-related issues common in beachside properties.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Holiday cottages often tempt owners toward quick DIY fixes to save money before the family arrives. Resist this urge. The combination of properties sitting empty (allowing problems to develop unseen) and coastal conditions (accelerating corrosion) means hidden issues are common. A DIY fix that seems to work may fail dramatically when the family's in residence. Use a qualified electrician for proper diagnosis and repair. The pre-holiday inspection cost is minimal compared to a ruined family vacation.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Request quotes through ProHub to connect with electricians servicing Hartenbos. Most are based in Mossel Bay or George and know Hartenbos properties well. For holiday home owners, many electricians offer pre-season inspection packages and can coordinate access through neighbours, managing agents, or key safes. Emergency callouts during December-January are in high demand — book ahead where possible or accept premium rates for urgent holiday period work.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "For Hartenbos properties, choose an electrician experienced with holiday home logistics. They should offer pre-season inspections, respond reliably to urgent calls during your visits, and ideally have a relationship with local property managers. Check ProHub reviews from other Hartenbos holiday homeowners. Ask about their availability during peak December season — the best electricians book up quickly.",

    {
      "question": "Can I get a pre-holiday electrical inspection for my Hartenbos cottage?",
      "answer": "Absolutely — this is one of the most common requests from Hartenbos property owners. Electricians check the DB board, test circuits, inspect geysers, verify that appliances are safe, and identify any issues before your family arrives. Book 2-4 weeks before your visit for best availability."
    },
    {
      "question": "My Hartenbos flat has been empty for months — what should I check?",
      "answer": "After months empty, have an electrician check for rodent damage to wiring (common in vacant properties), test the geyser element and thermostat, verify earth leakage protection, and check for corrosion in the DB board. A general inspection costs R800-R1,500 and provides peace of mind."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Hartenbos electricians work during December holidays?",
      "answer": "Yes, though availability is limited and rates may be higher for urgent work. The December-January period is the busiest time for Hartenbos electricians. For non-emergency work, book before the holiday rush or schedule for January after the peak crowds leave."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I install a prepaid meter in my Hartenbos rental property?",
      "answer": "Prepaid meters are popular for Hartenbos rental properties — they eliminate bill disputes and ensure tenants only use electricity they've paid for. Installation costs R2,500-R4,000 including meter, wiring, and commissioning. Requires municipal approval in some areas."
