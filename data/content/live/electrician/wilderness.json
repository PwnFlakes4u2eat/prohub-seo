  "guideIntro": "Wilderness lives up to its name — this spectacular village is nestled between indigenous forests, pristine beaches, and a national park, just minutes from George. The natural beauty attracts both permanent residents and a steady stream of holidaymakers, while the challenging terrain and weather patterns create unique electrical demands. Properties perched on hills face lightning exposure, riverside homes deal with humidity, and the area's popularity means reliable backup power is essential for guesthouses and holiday rentals. ProHub connects Wilderness residents with verified electricians experienced in this unique environment.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Wilderness electricians regularly handle terrain-specific challenges alongside standard residential work. Popular services include lightning and surge protection installations (essential given the area's exposure), solar and battery systems for off-grid resilience, geyser repairs and replacements, DB board upgrades, and outdoor lighting for the many properties with expansive gardens. The hospitality sector drives demand for reliable backup power and emergency response — guests at a Wilderness guesthouse expect the lights to stay on. Many electricians also have experience with properties in the Wilderness Heights and Hoekwil areas.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Wilderness properties face tougher conditions than typical suburban homes. Lightning strikes are not unusual — surge damage can cascade through entire electrical systems. The forest environment means trees fall on power lines, creating outages and surges. Humidity from the rivers and ocean attacks wiring and connections. This is not the place for DIY electrical work. Professional electricians know how to install protection systems and use appropriate components for the conditions. Your beautiful Wilderness property deserves proper electrical care.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Request quotes through ProHub to connect with electricians who service Wilderness. Most are based in nearby George (a 10-minute drive) with some local operators. Response times are typically quick — George electricians know Wilderness well and service it regularly. For properties in Wilderness Heights, Hoekwil, or on private roads, provide clear directions when requesting quotes. Emergency callouts are available for the frequent storm-related issues.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "When choosing a Wilderness electrician, prioritise experience with the area's specific challenges. Ask about surge protection expertise, familiarity with properties in your specific area (village, heights, Hoekwil), and response times for emergencies. For guesthouses and holiday rentals, find an electrician who can provide reliable after-hours support during your busy seasons. Check ProHub reviews from other Wilderness property owners.",

      "answer": "Strongly recommended. Wilderness's elevated terrain and proximity to the coast makes it lightning-prone. Surge protection on your DB board (R1,500-R4,000 installed) can save thousands in appliance damage. Many Wilderness electricians recommend whole-house surge protection as standard."

    },
    {
      "question": "What backup power system suits a Wilderness guesthouse?",
      "answer": "Guesthouses in Wilderness typically need 8-15kW inverter systems with 15-30kWh battery storage to maintain guest comfort during load shedding. Solar panels reduce running costs. A qualified electrician can assess your specific loads and recommend appropriate sizing. Expect R80,000-R180,000 for quality installations."
