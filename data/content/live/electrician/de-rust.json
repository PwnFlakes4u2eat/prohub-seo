  "guideIntro": "De Rust is a beautifully preserved Victorian village at the entrance to Meiringspoort, the dramatic pass through the Swartberg mountains. This architectural gem attracts visitors exploring Route 62 and serves as a gateway to the Karoo interior. The village's historic character means most properties are heritage buildings requiring sensitive electrical work, while the tourism economy drives demand for reliable guesthouse power. Surrounding farms add agricultural electrical needs to the mix. ProHub connects De Rust property owners with verified electricians who appreciate both the history and practical needs of this unique village.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "De Rust electricians specialise in heritage property work alongside standard services. Popular jobs include sympathetic rewiring of Victorian cottages (concealing modern wiring within historic structures), guesthouse backup power systems, DB board upgrades that fit period-appropriate enclosures, solar installations for off-grid capability, and farm electrical services. The village's tourism focus means reliability is paramount — guests expect working facilities.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "De Rust's heritage properties deserve professional care. Attempting DIY electrical work in Victorian cottages risks damaging historic fabric and rarely meets the standards expected for properties in this architecturally significant village. Guest accommodation has strict safety requirements. Farm installations involve hazards beyond typical residential work. Use qualified electricians who understand heritage contexts.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Request quotes through ProHub to connect with electricians servicing De Rust. The village is primarily served by Oudtshoorn contractors (25km), with excellent access via the R341. For heritage work, expect electricians to show sensitivity to historic buildings — ask about their approach to concealing wiring and maintaining period character. Farm and agricultural work follows standard assessment and quoting processes.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "When choosing an electrician for De Rust, prioritise heritage property experience. Ask to see examples of previous work in historic buildings. For guesthouses, find an electrician who provides responsive service during peak tourist seasons. Farm clients should confirm relevant agricultural experience. In this small community, local recommendations carry weight.",

      "question": "My De Rust guesthouse needs backup power — what options exist?",
      "answer": "Solar with battery backup is ideal for De Rust guesthouses, given excellent Karoo sunshine. A 5-10kW system with 10-20kWh battery storage handles typical guesthouse loads (lights, kitchen, guest amenities). Expect R70,000-R120,000 for quality installations."
    },
    {
