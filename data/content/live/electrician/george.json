  "guideIntro": "As the largest city on the Garden Route and the economic hub of the Southern Cape, George has a thriving construction and property market that keeps local electricians busy year-round. Whether you're in Blanco dealing with load shedding damage, Heatherlands needing a solar installation, or Thembalethu requiring emergency repairs, finding a qualified electrician you can trust is essential. ProHub connects George residents with verified electrical professionals who understand local building codes, Eskom compliance requirements, and the unique challenges of working in coastal and semi-rural properties throughout the Garden Route.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "George electricians offer comprehensive services ranging from basic fault-finding and repairs to complex commercial installations. Popular services include DB board upgrades (essential given South Africa's ageing infrastructure), solar panel and inverter installations (George receives excellent solar exposure), Certificate of Compliance inspections for property sales, geyser element replacements, and full house rewiring for older Denneoord and Pacaltsdorp properties. Many George electricians also specialise in prepaid meter installations, security system wiring, and backup power solutions — particularly relevant given ongoing load shedding schedules.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "While changing a light bulb or resetting a tripped breaker is safe for anyone, South African law is clear: only a registered electrician may perform electrical installation work. This isn't just bureaucracy — it's safety. Faulty DIY wiring causes house fires, electric shocks, and can void your home insurance. In George specifically, the municipality requires a valid CoC for any property transfer, and insurance claims involving electrical fires will be rejected without proper certification. Save the YouTube tutorials for other jobs.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a request through ProHub, up to 5 verified George electricians will receive your job details and can send you quotes. Most customers get their first response within 30 minutes, with multiple quotes arriving within a few hours. Each quote should include a breakdown of parts, labour, and callout fees. For solar installations or larger projects, expect electricians to request a site visit before providing a final quote. Always confirm whether the quoted price includes the CoC if one is required for your job.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond the lowest price when choosing a George electrician. Check that they're registered with the Department of Employment and Labour (you can verify registration numbers online), read their ProHub reviews from previous George customers, and ask about their experience with your specific job type. For solar installations, confirm they're a certified PV GreenCard installer. Request proof of liability insurance — reputable electricians carry this as standard. Finally, get everything in writing before work begins.",

      "question": "Do George electricians work during load shedding?",
      "answer": "Most George electricians work normal hours regardless of load shedding and can complete many tasks without mains power. However, testing and commissioning work requires power, so they may need to schedule accordingly.
