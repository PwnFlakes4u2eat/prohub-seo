  "guideIntro": "Barrydale is the creative heart of the Klein Karoo — a village on Route 62 where artists, craftspeople, and weekenders from Cape Town have created a vibrant community alongside established farming families. This artistic energy has transformed the village with galleries, studios, restaurants, and stylishly renovated cottages. The mix of creative enterprises and traditional Karoo properties creates interesting electrical demands: artist studios needing good lighting, historic cottages requiring sensitive upgrades, modern guesthouses expecting reliable power, and surrounding farms needing practical agricultural services. ProHub connects Barrydale's diverse community with verified electricians.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Barrydale electricians serve an unusually varied client base. Popular services include artist studio fit-outs (specialised lighting for workshops and galleries), guesthouse backup power systems, sympathetic rewiring of historic village cottages, solar installations for off-grid capability, restaurant and café electrical work, and farm services for the surrounding agricultural community. The Warmwaterberg area adds hot spring resort facilities to the mix. Electricians here must adapt to both creative and practical briefs.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Barrydale's creative community often includes skilled makers comfortable with tools, but electrical work remains professional territory. The village's mix of heritage cottages and business premises requires compliant installations. Guest accommodation and food service have specific safety requirements. Art studio lighting demands proper electrical design to avoid flickering or interference. Channel that DIY energy elsewhere and use registered electricians for electrical work.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Request quotes through ProHub to connect with electricians servicing Barrydale. The village is served by local operators and contractors from Montagu and Ladismith. Creative briefs (studio lighting, gallery fit-outs) may benefit from initial consultation discussions before formal quoting. The artistic community has driven demand for thoughtful work that respects character — expect electricians familiar with this approach.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Barrydale's eclectic community means different jobs need different approaches. For creative spaces, find electricians who understand lighting design and visual requirements. For heritage cottages, confirm sensitive rewiring experience. For guesthouses, prioritise reliability and responsive service. For farms, practical agricultural experience matters most. Match the electrician to the job.",

    },
    {
      "question": "My historic Barrydale cottage needs rewiring — how do you approach this?",
