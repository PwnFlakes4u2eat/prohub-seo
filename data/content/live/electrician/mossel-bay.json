  "guideIntro": "Mossel Bay marks the official start of the Garden Route and boasts South Africa's mildest year-round climate — but don't let the pleasant weather fool you into thinking electrical systems here have it easy. The industrial harbour, PetroSA refinery, and growing residential developments in Dana Bay and Pinnacle Point all create strong demand for qualified electricians. Whether you need urgent repairs in KwaNonqaba, a solar installation at your Hartenbos holiday flat, or industrial electrical work near the harbour, ProHub connects you with verified Mossel Bay electricians who know the local landscape.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Mossel Bay electricians handle everything from residential repairs to industrial installations. Popular residential services include DB board upgrades, solar and inverter systems (Mossel Bay's excellent sunshine makes solar particularly cost-effective), geyser element replacements, and pre-sale CoC inspections. The area's mix of old fisherman's cottages and modern developments means electricians here are experienced with both heritage rewiring and new construction. Industrial services near the harbour and refinery include three-phase installations, motor controls, and compliance inspections.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Mossel Bay's combination of coastal salt air and mixed-age housing stock makes electrical DIY riskier than it might appear. Corrosion can hide behind walls, and what looks like a simple fix might reveal decades-old wiring. South African law requires all installation work to be done by registered electricians — this isn't optional. Beyond legality, consider that your home insurance requires compliant electrical work, and DIY mistakes in Mossel Bay's humidity can fail faster than you'd expect.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Request quotes through ProHub and receive responses from up to 5 verified Mossel Bay electricians. Response times are typically excellent — the town's active contractor community means you'll often get quotes within hours. For emergency repairs, same-day service is usually available. Larger projects like solar installations will require a site assessment. Mossel Bay electricians can often source parts locally through well-stocked hardware suppliers, avoiding delays waiting for stock from George or Cape Town.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Mossel Bay has a solid base of established electricians alongside newer operators. Verify registration status (Department of Employment and Labour database), read ProHub reviews, and ask about experience with your specific job type. For coastal properties in Dana Bay or Pinnacle Point, ask about corrosion-resistant components. Industrial clients should confirm relevant certifications and experience with three-phase systems. Always get written quotes and confirm CoC issuance where required.",
