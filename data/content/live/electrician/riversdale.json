  "guideIntro": "Riversdale serves as the commercial hub for the agricultural communities of the Hessequa region, positioned on the N2 between Mossel Bay and Swellendam. This hardworking farming town supports the surrounding wheat, sheep, and dairy farms while maintaining a close-knit community atmosphere. Electrical needs here differ from coastal tourist towns — farm installations, agricultural motors, older town properties, and practical rural solutions take priority over luxury features. ProHub connects Riversdale residents and farmers with verified electricians who understand both town and farm electrical requirements.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Riversdale electricians handle a broad range of work from residential repairs to agricultural installations. Popular services include farm motor and pump electrical systems, borehole pump wiring, three-phase installations for agricultural equipment, DB board upgrades in town properties, solar installations (farms have excellent space and sun exposure), and prepaid meter systems. The area's established buildings often require sympathetic upgrades that maintain functionality without unnecessary expense.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Farming communities value self-reliance, and many Riversdale residents are handy with tools. However, electrical work carries legal requirements and genuine safety risks that make professional help essential. Farm electrical systems often involve higher voltages and currents than residential work, and water and grain handling equipment create additional hazards. A registered electrician ensures your installation is safe, compliant, and properly documented for insurance purposes.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Request quotes through ProHub to connect with electricians servicing Riversdale. The town has local electrical contractors familiar with both agricultural and residential work. For farm installations, expect electricians to request site visits before quoting complex jobs. The practical Riversdale approach means quotes are typically straightforward and honest — fancy presentations are less common than fair prices and reliable work.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "When choosing a Riversdale electrician, consider their experience with your specific needs. Farm electrical work requires different skills than residential — confirm relevant experience. For town properties, standard residential expertise applies. Check ProHub reviews and ask neighbours for recommendations. The Riversdale community is small enough that reputation matters — good electricians are known, and so are poor ones.",

      "question": "My farm borehole pump keeps tripping — what's wrong?",
      "answer": "Borehole pump tripping commonly indicates motor problems, water ingress, cable damage, or inadequate supply capacity.
