  "guideIntro": "Great Brak River — affectionately known as 'Groot Brak' — is a tranquil village at the mouth of the Great Brak River, positioned between Mossel Bay and George on the Garden Route. This peaceful community attracts retirees, families seeking quiet coastal living, and holiday visitors who prefer a relaxed atmosphere over busy resort towns. The village's mix of established homes, newer developments in Glentana and Tergniet, and riverside properties creates varied electrical needs. ProHub connects Great Brak River residents with verified electricians who service this welcoming community.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Great Brak River electricians handle standard residential work with attention to the area's specific character. Popular services include DB board upgrades (many older village homes need modernisation), solar installations for energy independence, geyser repairs and replacements, security system wiring, and general maintenance for the area's growing number of retirement homes. The estuary and coastal location means electricians here understand moisture-related challenges and can recommend appropriate components for longevity.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Great Brak River's peaceful atmosphere and strong community spirit might make asking a handy neighbour seem easier than hiring an electrician. However, South African law is clear about who can do electrical work, and the consequences of non-compliance are serious. Faulty wiring causes fires and electric shocks, insurance claims are rejected without proper CoCs, and property sales require compliant installations. Support local businesses by using qualified electricians — they're your neighbours too.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Request quotes through ProHub to connect with electricians servicing Great Brak River. The village is served by contractors from Mossel Bay and George, all within easy reach. Response times are generally good — the central location between the two larger towns means electricians pass through regularly. For the village's significant retiree community, many electricians are experienced with patient explanations and respectful service.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "When selecting an electrician for Great Brak River, check that they service the area regularly rather than treating it as an occasional distant callout. Read ProHub reviews from other local residents. For ongoing maintenance needs (common among retirees), find an electrician willing to build a long-term relationship. Ask about senior-friendly service approaches if relevant — the best tradespeople adapt to their customers' needs.",

      "answer": "Great Brak River electrician rates typically match Mossel Bay — R350-R500 per hour with callout fees of R350-R600. The village's position between Mossel Bay and George means good contractor availability without significant travel premiums."

    {
      "question": "Do electricians service Glentana and Tergniet?",
      "answer": "Yes, ProHub electricians cover all Great Brak River areas including the village centre, Glentana, and Tergniet. These newer developments are well-known to local contractors who have worked on many of the homes during construction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get solar installed at my Great Brak River home?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Solar is increasingly popular in Great Brak River for both cost savings and load shedding resilience. The area's excellent sunshine makes solar particularly effective. Typical residential systems (5-8kW with battery) run R50,000-R90,000 and suit the moderate power needs of most village homes."
    },
    {
      "question": "My Great Brak River home is old — does it need rewiring?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. A CoC inspection will assess your current installation and identify specific issues. Often, targeted upgrades to DB boards, earth leakage protection, and problem circuits are sufficient without full rewiring. Get a professional assessment rather than assuming the worst."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can I get an electrician in Great Brak River?",
      "answer": "Standard jobs can typically be scheduled within 2-5 days. Emergency callouts are usually available same-day given the village's proximity to Mossel Bay and George. Peak holiday periods may see longer wait times."
