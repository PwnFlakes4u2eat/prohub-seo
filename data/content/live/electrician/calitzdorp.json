  "guideIntro": "Calitzdorp, the port wine capital of South Africa, is a charming Klein Karoo village on Route 62 between Oudtshoorn and Ladismith. This small wine-producing town draws visitors to its renowned port cellars while serving the surrounding farming community. The village atmosphere belies real electrical needs — wineries require specialised installations, historic village properties need careful upgrades, and surrounding farms depend on reliable power for irrigation and processing. ProHub connects Calitzdorp residents and businesses with verified electricians who understand this unique community.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Calitzdorp electricians handle village residential work alongside agricultural and winery-specific services. Popular work includes winery cellar electrical systems (temperature control, pressing equipment, lighting), farm irrigation pump installations, borehole systems, DB board upgrades for historic village cottages, solar installations (excellent in the Karoo sun), and guesthouse electrical maintenance. The mix of old and new — heritage cottages alongside modern wine production facilities — requires versatile electricians.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Calitzdorp's village scale and strong community connections might make informal arrangements tempting, but electrical safety requirements apply equally here. Wineries have specific compliance requirements, guest accommodation needs proper certification, and even simple residential work should be done by registered electricians for insurance and resale purposes. Support local professionals and keep your property compliant.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Request quotes through ProHub to connect with electricians servicing Calitzdorp. The village is primarily served by contractors from Oudtshoorn (30km) with some from Ladismith. The small local market means fewer contractors, but those who work here know the area well. For winery work, confirm relevant experience with cellar environments and equipment.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "In small communities like Calitzdorp, word of mouth matters enormously. Ask local winery owners, guesthouse operators, and neighbours for recommendations. Check ProHub reviews. For specialised winery work, confirm experience with similar installations elsewhere in the Klein Karoo wine region.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can I get an electrician in Calitzdorp?",
      "answer": "Planned work can typically be scheduled within 4-7 days. Emergency response depends on contractor availability from Oudtshoorn — same-day is possible but not guaranteed. For harvest season winery emergencies, establish relationships with electricians in advance."

    {
      "question": "My Calitzdorp cottage has very old wiring — what should I do?",
      "answer": "Get a CoC inspection to assess the current state. Many historic Klein Karoo cottages have outdated wiring that needs upgrading, but full rewiring isn't always required. Targeted improvements to DB boards and key circuits may suffice. A professional assessment provides the answer."
