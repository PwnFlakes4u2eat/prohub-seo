  "guideIntro": "Plettenberg Bay — 'Plett' to locals and regulars — is one of South Africa's most upmarket coastal destinations, attracting wealthy holidaymakers and increasingly, permanent residents seeking the coastal lifestyle. This creates unique electrical demands: high-end homes with sophisticated automation systems, luxury holiday rentals requiring reliable backup power, and an older town centre with properties needing careful upgrades. ProHub connects Plett residents and property owners with verified electricians who can handle everything from routine repairs to complex smart home installations.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Plettenberg Bay electricians cater to the area's premium market. Beyond standard repairs and CoC inspections, popular services include whole-house backup power systems (inverters and batteries sized for large homes), solar installations for energy independence, home automation and smart lighting, underfloor heating installations, and pool pump electrical work. The rental and Airbnb market also drives demand for reliable callout services — guests don't tolerate electrical problems. Many Plett electricians are experienced with architect-designed homes and work alongside builders on new construction projects.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Plett's property values make cutting corners particularly costly. Faulty electrical work can void insurance on a multi-million rand property, and buyer due diligence during sales is thorough — expect CoC issues to be flagged. The humid coastal climate also means connections degrade faster than inland. Unless you're literally changing a light bulb, use a qualified electrician. The premium Plett market supports quality contractors — don't undermine your property value with amateur work.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Request quotes through ProHub and typically receive responses within hours from verified Plett electricians. The area's premium market means electricians here are experienced with demanding clients and complex jobs. For holiday homes, many can coordinate with your property manager or provide video consultations. Expect thorough quotations that detail parts and labour separately. For large projects, site visits are standard before final pricing — a sign of professionalism, not hesitation.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Plettenberg Bay's electrical market includes established local firms and contractors who've relocated seeking lifestyle. Verify registration, check ProHub reviews, and ask specifically about experience with high-end residential work. For home automation, confirm familiarity with your preferred systems. Request references from similar projects if tackling a major installation. The right electrician becomes a long-term relationship for property maintenance — choose accordingly.",
