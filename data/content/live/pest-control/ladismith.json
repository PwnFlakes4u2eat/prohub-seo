  "guideIntro": "Ladismith, nestled beneath the dramatic Towerkop mountain, is an agricultural town where pest control needs reflect its cheese-making heritage and Klein Karoo climate. The town's famous cheese factory, fruit farming operations, and grain storage all attract rodents, while the semi-arid environment supports scorpions, spiders, and various Karoo insects. The historic town centre features older buildings requiring vigilant wood borer monitoring, while the surrounding farmland presents its own pest management challenges. Hot summers drive insects indoors, and cold Klein Karoo winters see increased rodent activity. ProHub connects Ladismith residents and agricultural businesses with verified pest controllers who understand this productive farming community.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Ladismith pest control companies provide services suited to this agricultural community. Core offerings include rodent control essential for cheese factories, fruit storage, and farming operations; comprehensive insect treatments for cockroaches, flies, ants, and the scorpions and spiders common in the Karoo; wood borer inspections and fumigation for historic buildings; termite assessments and treatments; and bee and wasp removal. Agricultural clients can access food-industry compliant pest programmes. Many providers also serve Calitzdorp and Barrydale.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats avoid poorly placed traps — particularly problematic near food production. Scorpions require targeted treatment. Wood borer and termite treatments need specialised equipment and registered pesticides. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products, understand food industry requirements, and provide certificates and guarantees.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, up to 5 verified Ladismith pest controllers receive your details. Most respond within hours — faster for urgent infestations. Expect questions about the type of pest, severity of the problem, property type, and any food production or agricultural connections. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will need to conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing. Quotes should include treatment methods and any certifications provided.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. If you operate food production or agricultural facilities, ask about HACCP compliance and food industry experience. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness and professionalism. Ask about guarantee policies. For wood borer certificates, ensure they're qualified to issue certificates recognised by conveyancing attorneys.",

    {
      "question": "What pests are common in Ladismith?",
      "answer": "Ladismith's agricultural setting and Klein Karoo climate create specific pest populations. Most common are rodents (attracted to cheese production, fruit, and grain storage), flies during summer, scorpions and spiders in the rocky terrain, cockroaches, and ants. The dry climate means fewer moisture-related pests than coastal areas. Seasonal patterns see increased fly activity in summer and rodent problems in winter."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in Ladismith?",
      "answer": "Yes, most conveyancing attorneys require a wood borer and beetle-free certificate before property transfer. A qualified pest inspector examines roof timbers, wooden floors, door frames, and furniture for signs of active infestation or previous damage. If treatment is needed, the property is fumigated and a clearance certificate issued. Budget R1,400-R3,200 depending on property size and whether treatment is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I control pests at my Ladismith farm or food facility?",
      "answer": "Agricultural and food facilities require professional pest management programmes. Rodent control must use tamper-proof bait stations suitable for food-adjacent areas. Fly management is essential during summer. Regular inspections and treatments should be documented for compliance purposes. Professional pest controllers can design HACCP-compliant programmes. Keep storage areas clean, seal entry points, and maintain good sanitation practices between professional treatments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Ladismith pest controllers offer emergency callouts?",
      "answer": "Yes, many Ladismith pest control companies offer same-day or emergency services for urgent situations like severe infestations or dangerous pest encounters. This is particularly important for food production facilities where pests can compromise product safety. Weekend and after-hours callouts typically carry a premium of R200-R450. Mark your ProHub request as urgent for faster responses."
