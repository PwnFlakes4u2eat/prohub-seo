  "guideIntro": "Sedgefield's reputation as a peaceful 'slow town' belies its active pest populations. Nestled between the Swartvlei lagoon and indigenous forest, this Garden Route gem experiences pest pressures from both coastal and woodland environments. The village's mix of permanent residents, retirees, and holiday homeowners means properties range from well-maintained family homes to cottages that sit empty between visits. The famous Saturday Wild Oats Market attracts visitors but also creates food waste that draws rodents. Cola Beach and Myoli Beach properties face salt air and humidity that accelerates wood borer damage. ProHub connects Sedgefield residents with verified pest controllers who appreciate the town's relaxed pace while responding promptly to pest emergencies.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Sedgefield pest control companies provide services tailored to this small coastal community. Offerings include rodent control essential for properties near the market area and lagoon; comprehensive insect treatments for cockroaches, ants, and the sand fleas common at Cola and Myoli beaches; wood borer inspections and fumigation particularly important for Sedgefield's many timber cottages; termite assessments and treatments; bird management for properties affected by the abundant birdlife around the lagoon; and bee and wasp nest removal. Many pest controllers offer maintenance programmes suited to the town's significant holiday home population.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas — behind fridges, inside wall cavities, under sinks — where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats are neophobic (fear new objects) and will avoid poorly placed traps for weeks. Wood borer and termite treatments require specialised detection equipment and registered pesticides that aren't available to consumers. For bee or wasp nests, attempting removal without proper protection risks serious stings and, for those with allergies, life-threatening reactions. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products, know exactly where pests hide, and provide certificates and guarantees on their work.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, up to 5 verified Sedgefield pest controllers receive your details. Given Sedgefield's smaller size, some providers may come from nearby George or Knysna. Most respond within hours — faster for urgent infestations. Expect questions about the type of pest, severity of the problem, and property size. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will need to conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing. Quotes should include the treatment method, products used, safety information, any certificates provided, and follow-up visits included.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness — did the pests actually stay gone? — and professionalism. Ask about their guarantee policy: reputable companies offer free follow-up treatments if pests return within a specified period. For wood borer certificates, ensure they're qualified to issue certificates recognised by conveyancing attorneys. Companies that take time to explain the treatment process and provide aftercare instructions typically deliver better results than those offering suspiciously cheap quotes.",

  "faqs": [

    },
    {
      "question": "What pests are common in Sedgefield?",
      "answer": "Sedgefield's lagoon and forest location creates diverse pest pressures. Most common are cockroaches (thriving in coastal humidity), rats and mice (especially near the market area and restaurants), wood borers in timber cottages and beach houses, and sand fleas near Cola and Myoli beaches. The abundant birdlife occasionally becomes problematic for certain properties. Wasps build nests in garden sheds and under eaves during warmer months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in Sedgefield?",
      "answer": "Yes, most conveyancing attorneys require a wood borer and beetle-free certificate before property transfer. This is particularly important in Sedgefield where many homes feature timber construction common in Garden Route beach cottages. A qualified pest inspector examines roof timbers, wooden floors, door frames, and furniture for signs of infestation. Budget R1,500-R3,500 depending on property size."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I control pests at my Sedgefield holiday cottage?",
      "answer": "Holiday cottages need preventative care. Before leaving, remove or seal all food, empty bins, and fix any dripping taps. Seal gaps around pipes and under doors. Many Sedgefield pest controllers offer maintenance programmes — they'll inspect and treat your cottage between visits. Consider quarterly preventative treatments. Ask a neighbour to report any pest signs, and schedule a treatment before your next visit if the cottage has been empty for months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Sedgefield pest controllers offer emergency callouts?",
      "answer": "Yes, pest control companies serving Sedgefield offer emergency services, though some may come from George or Knysna. Same-day service is usually available for urgent situations like wasp nests or severe infestations. Weekend and after-hours callouts typically carry a premium of R200-R500. Mark your ProHub request as urgent for faster responses."
