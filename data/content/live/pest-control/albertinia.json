  "guideIntro": "Albertinia, known as the 'Aloe Capital' of South Africa, is a small agricultural town where pest control plays an important role in protecting both homes and the aloe processing industry that drives the local economy. The town's position on the N2 between Riversdale and Mossel Bay means it experiences pest pressures typical of farming communities — rodents attracted to stored crops and processing facilities, flies during summer months, and the general household pests that affect every home. The mix of established village properties and smallholdings presents varied treatment needs. ProHub connects Albertinia residents and businesses with verified pest controllers who serve this tight-knit community and understand its agricultural character.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Albertinia pest control companies provide essential services for this farming community. Core offerings include rodent control critical for aloe processing facilities and properties near agricultural storage; comprehensive insect treatments for cockroaches, flies, ants, and general household pests; wood borer inspections and fumigation for the town's established buildings; termite assessments and treatments; and bee and wasp nest removal. Some providers offer commercial programmes for agricultural clients while maintaining residential services. Many pest controllers also cover nearby Riversdale and Still Bay.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas — behind fridges, inside wall cavities, under sinks — where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats are neophobic (fear new objects) and will avoid poorly placed traps for weeks. Wood borer and termite treatments require specialised detection equipment and registered pesticides that aren't available to consumers. For bee or wasp nests, attempting removal without proper protection risks serious stings and, for those with allergies, life-threatening reactions. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products, know exactly where pests hide, and provide certificates and guarantees on their work.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, verified pest controllers serving Albertinia receive your details. Given the town's smaller size, some providers may operate from Mossel Bay or Riversdale. Most respond within hours — faster for urgent infestations. Expect questions about the type of pest, severity of the problem, property size, and any agricultural connections. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will need to conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness — did the pests actually stay gone? — and professionalism. Ask about their guarantee policy: reputable companies offer free follow-up treatments if pests return within a specified period. For wood borer certificates, ensure they're qualified to issue certificates recognised by conveyancing attorneys.",

      "question": "What pests are common in Albertinia?",
      "answer": "Albertinia's agricultural environment influences its pest populations. Most common are rats and mice (attracted to aloe processing facilities and farming activities), flies during summer, cockroaches, and general household insects. The drier climate compared to coastal areas means certain pests like mosquitoes are less prevalent. Seasonal patterns see rodent activity increase in winter as they seek shelter in buildings."

      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in Albertinia?",
      "answer": "Yes, most conveyancing attorneys require a wood borer and beetle-free certificate before property transfer. A qualified pest inspector examines roof timbers, wooden floors, door frames, and furniture for signs of active infestation or previous damage. If treatment is needed, the property is fumigated and a clearance certificate issued. Budget R1,400-R3,200 depending on property size and whether treatment is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I prevent pests at my Albertinia smallholding?",
      "answer": "Smallholdings require comprehensive pest prevention. Store animal feed in sealed containers, maintain buildings to eliminate entry points, and remove debris that provides hiding spots. Consider ongoing baiting programmes for rodents. Keep grass and vegetation trimmed near buildings. Professional pest controllers can design a maintenance programme suited to your property size and activities. Regular quarterly treatments help prevent infestations from establishing."
