  "guideIntro": "Still Bay (Stilbaai) has transformed from a quiet fishing village to a sought-after coastal destination, and its pest control needs have evolved accordingly. This charming town split between Still Bay West and Still Bay East, along with nearby Jongensfontein and Melkhoutfontein, combines permanent residential areas with a significant holiday home population. The coastal humidity creates ideal conditions for cockroaches and wood borers, while the fishing heritage means properties near the harbour deal with flies and rodents attracted to fish processing. The ancient fish traps that make Still Bay famous are a reminder that this area has always needed to coexist with nature — including its pests. ProHub connects Still Bay property owners with verified pest controllers who understand this unique coastal community.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Still Bay pest control companies provide services suited to this coastal fishing community. Core offerings include rodent control essential for properties near the harbour and fish processing areas; comprehensive insect treatments for cockroaches, flies, ants, and sand fleas; wood borer inspections and fumigation critical for the town's many beach cottages; termite assessments and treatments; bird control for seagulls affecting commercial and harbour properties; and bee and wasp nest removal. Holiday home maintenance programmes help owners manage properties between visits. Many providers also service Jongensfontein and Melkhoutfontein.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas — behind fridges, inside wall cavities, under sinks — where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats are neophobic (fear new objects) and will avoid poorly placed traps for weeks. Wood borer and termite treatments require specialised detection equipment and registered pesticides that aren't available to consumers. For bee or wasp nests, attempting removal without proper protection risks serious stings and, for those with allergies, life-threatening reactions. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products, know exactly where pests hide, and provide certificates and guarantees on their work.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, up to 5 verified pest controllers serving Still Bay receive your details. Given the town's size, some providers may operate from Riversdale or Mossel Bay. Most respond within hours — faster for urgent infestations. Expect questions about the type of pest, severity of the problem, property size, and whether it's a holiday property. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will need to conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness — did the pests actually stay gone? — and professionalism. Ask about their guarantee policy: reputable companies offer free follow-up treatments if pests return within a specified period. For wood borer certificates, ensure they're qualified to issue certificates recognised by conveyancing attorneys.",

    {
      "question": "What pests are common in Still Bay?",
      "answer": "Still Bay's coastal fishing environment creates specific pest pressures. Most common are cockroaches (thriving in seaside humidity), flies near the harbour and fish processing areas, rats and mice, and wood borers in timber beach cottages. Sand fleas affect beach properties, and seagulls can be problematic near the harbour. Wasps build nests in garden sheds during warmer months. Holiday homes that sit empty are particularly vulnerable to infestations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in Still Bay?",
      "answer": "Yes, most conveyancing attorneys require a wood borer and beetle-free certificate before property transfer. This is especially important in Still Bay where many beach cottages feature timber construction. A qualified pest inspector examines roof timbers, wooden floors, door frames, and furniture for signs of infestation. Budget R1,450-R3,300 depending on property size and whether treatment is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I maintain pest control at my Still Bay holiday home?",
      "answer": "Holiday homes need special attention. Before leaving, remove or seal all food, empty bins, and fix any dripping taps that attract pests. Seal gaps around pipes and under doors. Many Still Bay pest controllers offer maintenance programmes — they'll inspect and treat your property between visits. Schedule treatments before peak holiday seasons. Ask a neighbour or property manager to report any pest signs during your absence."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Still Bay pest controllers offer emergency callouts?",
      "answer": "Yes, pest control companies serving Still Bay offer emergency services, though providers may travel from Riversdale or Mossel Bay. Same-day service is usually available for urgent situations like wasp nests or severe infestations. Weekend and after-hours callouts typically carry a premium of R200-R500. Mark your ProHub request as urgent for faster responses."
