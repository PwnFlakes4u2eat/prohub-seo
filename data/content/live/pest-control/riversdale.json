  "guideIntro": "Riversdale serves as a service centre for the surrounding farming communities, and its pest control needs reflect this agricultural character. Located on the N2 between Mossel Bay and Swellendam, this historic town faces pest pressures from both its rural surroundings and the traffic that passes through. Grain storage and agricultural activities attract rodents, while the mix of older Victorian-era homes and newer residential areas presents varied treatment challenges. The Garcia community and central Riversdale each have different pest profiles. Summer heat drives insects indoors, while winter sees increased rodent activity as they seek shelter. ProHub connects Riversdale residents and businesses with verified pest controllers who understand the town's agricultural context.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Riversdale pest control companies provide services suited to this farming community. Core offerings include rodent control essential for properties near grain storage and agricultural facilities; comprehensive insect treatments for cockroaches, ants, flies, and general household pests; wood borer inspections and fumigation important for Riversdale's many historic buildings; termite assessments and soil treatments; and bee and wasp nest removal. Agricultural clients can access farm-specific pest management, while residential customers benefit from regular maintenance programmes. Many providers also service nearby Albertinia and Still Bay.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas — behind fridges, inside wall cavities, under sinks — where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats are neophobic (fear new objects) and will avoid poorly placed traps for weeks. Wood borer and termite treatments require specialised detection equipment and registered pesticides that aren't available to consumers. For bee or wasp nests, attempting removal without proper protection risks serious stings and, for those with allergies, life-threatening reactions. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products, know exactly where pests hide, and provide certificates and guarantees on their work.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, up to 5 verified Riversdale pest controllers receive your details. Most respond within hours — faster for urgent infestations. Expect questions about the type of pest, severity of the problem, property size, and any agricultural connections. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will need to conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing. Quotes should include the treatment method, products used, safety information, and any follow-up visits included.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness — did the pests actually stay gone? — and professionalism. Ask about their guarantee policy: reputable companies offer free follow-up treatments if pests return within a specified period. For wood borer certificates, ensure they're qualified to issue certificates recognised by conveyancing attorneys. Companies that take time to explain the treatment process typically deliver better results.",

    {
      "question": "What pests are common in Riversdale?",
      "answer": "Riversdale's agricultural setting influences its pest populations. Most common are rats and mice (attracted to grain storage and farming activities), flies during summer months, cockroaches, and general household insects. Wood borers affect older buildings in town. Seasonal patterns are distinct — insect activity peaks in summer heat, while rodents become more problematic in winter. Properties near farms may experience higher pest pressure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in Riversdale?",
      "answer": "Yes, most conveyancing attorneys require a wood borer and beetle-free certificate before property transfer. This is particularly important in Riversdale where many historic properties feature original timber components. A qualified pest inspector examines roof timbers, wooden floors, door frames, and furniture for signs of infestation. Budget R1,400-R3,200 depending on property size and whether treatment is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I control rodents on my Riversdale property near farms?",
      "answer": "Properties near agricultural areas require proactive rodent management. Seal all entry points — mice can squeeze through 6mm gaps. Store food in sealed containers and keep bins secure. Remove pet food at night. Consider ongoing baiting programmes rather than reactive treatment. Professional pest controllers can install tamper-proof bait stations around your property boundary. Regular monitoring catches problems early before populations explode."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Riversdale pest controllers offer emergency callouts?",
      "answer": "Yes, many Riversdale pest control companies offer same-day or emergency services for urgent situations like wasp nests, snake sightings, or severe infestations. Weekend and after-hours callouts typically carry a premium of R200-R450. When submitting your ProHub request, mark it as urgent and describe the situation clearly to get faster responses from available providers."
