  "guideIntro": "De Rust, the gateway to the spectacular Meiringspoort pass, is a charming Klein Karoo village where Victorian architecture meets semi-arid climate pest challenges. This small Route 62 town has become popular with artists and tree-changers seeking the quiet Karoo lifestyle, bringing new attention to maintaining its historic buildings against pests. The village's position at the entrance to Meiringspoort means properties experience both Karoo and mountain influences. Scorpions, spiders, and rodents are common in the rocky terrain, while the older Victorian homes require vigilant wood borer monitoring. ProHub connects De Rust residents with verified pest controllers who appreciate both the village's heritage buildings and its unique Karoo environment.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "De Rust pest control companies provide services suited to this heritage village. Core offerings include rodent control for properties and the small tourism businesses; comprehensive insect treatments for cockroaches, ants, scorpions, and spiders typical of the Karoo; wood borer inspections and fumigation essential for the village's Victorian buildings; termite assessments and treatments; and bee and wasp removal. Guest houses and holiday cottages can access regular maintenance programmes. Many providers serve the broader Klein Karoo from Oudtshoorn.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas — behind fridges, inside wall cavities, under sinks — where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats are neophobic and will avoid poorly placed traps. Scorpions require targeted treatment. Wood borer and termite treatments need specialised detection equipment and registered pesticides. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products, know where pests hide, and provide certificates and guarantees.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, verified pest controllers serving De Rust receive your details. Given the village's small size, most providers come from Oudtshoorn. Response times are typically within hours. Expect questions about the type of pest, severity of the problem, property age and style, and any heritage considerations. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. For De Rust's Victorian homes, ask about experience with heritage buildings — treatment methods should be effective without damaging original features. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness and professionalism. Ask about their guarantee policy. Ensure they're qualified to issue wood borer certificates.",

    {
      "question": "What pests are common in De Rust?",
      "answer": "De Rust's Klein Karoo setting creates specific pest populations. Most common are scorpions and spiders (thriving in the rocky terrain near Meiringspoort), rodents seeking shelter in buildings, cockroaches, and ants. Wood borers can affect the village's Victorian timber features. The dry climate means fewer mosquitoes than coastal areas. Seasonal patterns see increased rodent activity in the cold Karoo winters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in De Rust?",
      "answer": "Yes, most conveyancing attorneys require a wood borer and beetle-free certificate before property transfer. This is especially important in De Rust where many homes feature Victorian-era timber details including yellowwood floors, original doors, and exposed beams. A qualified pest inspector examines all timber components. Budget R1,400-R3,200 depending on property size and whether treatment is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I deal with scorpions at my De Rust property?",
      "answer": "Scorpions are common in De Rust's rocky Karoo environment. Reduce habitats by removing rock piles, debris, and woodpiles near your home. Seal gaps under doors and around pipes — scorpions can squeeze through small spaces. Keep grass short and clear vegetation from building perimeters. Professional pest controllers can apply barrier treatments. Always shake out shoes and check bedding, especially in summer months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do De Rust pest controllers offer emergency callouts?",
      "answer": "Yes, pest control companies serving De Rust offer emergency services, typically responding from Oudtshoorn (about 25km away). Same-day service is usually available for urgent situations. Weekend and after-hours callouts typically carry a premium of R200-R500. Mark your ProHub request as urgent for faster responses."
