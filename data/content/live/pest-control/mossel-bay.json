  "guideIntro": "Mossel Bay's position as the start of the Garden Route, combined with its industrial harbour and mild year-round climate, creates diverse pest challenges across the town. From the historic Point area with its older buildings to the expanding residential areas of Dana Bay and Pinnacle Point, properties face everything from cockroach infestations fuelled by coastal humidity to rodent problems near the harbour and commercial zones. The town's significant tourism industry means guest houses and restaurants require ongoing pest management, while the petrochemical industry brings unique commercial pest control needs. ProHub connects Mossel Bay residents and businesses with verified pest control professionals who understand local pest pressures and can provide both emergency response and preventative treatments.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Mossel Bay pest control companies offer comprehensive services suited to the town's coastal and industrial environment. Services include rodent control programmes targeting the rats common near the harbour, fishing industry, and restaurant areas; insect treatments for cockroaches, ants, fleas, and the flies attracted to fishing operations; wood borer inspections and fumigation critical for the town's many older properties; termite detection and treatment; bird control solutions for the seagulls and pigeons problematic in commercial and harbour areas; and bee and wasp removal. Commercial clients benefit from HACCP-compliant programmes, while residential customers can access regular maintenance contracts.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas — behind fridges, inside wall cavities, under sinks — where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats are neophobic (fear new objects) and will avoid poorly placed traps for weeks. Wood borer and termite treatments require specialised detection equipment and registered pesticides that aren't available to consumers. For bee or wasp nests, attempting removal without proper protection risks serious stings and, for those with allergies, life-threatening reactions. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products, know exactly where pests hide, and provide certificates and guarantees on their work.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, up to 5 verified Mossel Bay pest controllers receive your details. Most respond within hours — faster for urgent infestations. Expect questions about the type of pest, severity of the problem, and property size. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will need to conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing. Quotes should include the treatment method, products used, safety information (especially important if you have children or pets), any certificates provided, and follow-up visits included. For ongoing pest management, many Mossel Bay companies offer monthly or quarterly service contracts at reduced rates.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness — did the pests actually stay gone? — and professionalism. Ask about their guarantee policy: reputable companies offer free follow-up treatments if pests return within a specified period. For wood borer certificates, ensure they're qualified to issue certificates recognised by conveyancing attorneys. Companies that take time to explain the treatment process and provide aftercare instructions typically deliver better results than those offering suspiciously cheap quotes.",

    {
      "question": "What pests are common in Mossel Bay?",
      "answer": "Mossel Bay's coastal location and industrial activity create varied pest pressures. Most common are cockroaches (thriving in coastal humidity), rats and mice (especially near the harbour, fishing areas, and restaurants), flies attracted to the fishing industry, and wood borers in older properties. Seagulls cause significant problems in commercial areas. Seasonal increases in wasp activity occur from spring through autumn. Fleas are common in sandy coastal areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in Mossel Bay?",
      "answer": "Yes, most conveyancing attorneys in Mossel Bay require a wood borer and beetle-free certificate before property transfer. A qualified pest inspector examines roof timbers, wooden floors, door frames, and furniture for signs of active infestation or previous damage. If treatment is needed, the property is fumigated and a clearance certificate issued. Budget R1,500-R3,500 depending on property size and whether treatment is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I keep rodents out of my Mossel Bay property?",
      "answer": "Prevention is essential for rodent control in Mossel Bay, especially near the harbour and commercial areas. Seal gaps around pipes, under doors, and in walls — mice can squeeze through 6mm gaps. Store food in sealed containers, keep bins closed, and remove pet food at night. Properties near restaurants or the fishing industry need extra vigilance. For active infestations, professional baiting programmes are more effective than DIY traps."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Mossel Bay pest controllers offer emergency callouts?",
      "answer": "Yes, many Mossel Bay pest control companies offer same-day or emergency services for urgent situations like wasp nest discoveries, snake sightings, or severe infestations. Weekend and after-hours callouts typically carry a premium of R200-R500. When submitting your ProHub request, mark it as urgent and describe the situation clearly to get faster responses from available providers."
