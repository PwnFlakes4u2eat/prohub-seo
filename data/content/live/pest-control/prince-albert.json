  "guideIntro": "Prince Albert is one of the Klein Karoo's most picturesque towns, a heritage village famous for its figs, olives, and the dramatic Swartberg Pass that connects it to Oudtshoorn. This well-preserved 19th-century town has become a popular destination for those seeking Karoo tranquility, bringing new attention to maintaining its historic Cape Dutch and Victorian buildings. The semi-arid climate — hot summers, cold winters, and minimal rainfall — creates distinct pest populations including scorpions, spiders, and rodents that seek shelter in buildings. The town's irrigation furrows that feed the famous fig orchards create microhabitats that influence local pest patterns. ProHub connects Prince Albert residents and businesses with verified pest controllers who appreciate both the town's heritage and its unique Karoo environment.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Prince Albert pest control companies provide services suited to this heritage tourism destination. Core offerings include rodent control for properties, guest houses, and food production (fig drying, olive processing); comprehensive insect treatments for cockroaches, ants, scorpions, and the spiders common in Karoo buildings; wood borer inspections and fumigation essential for Prince Albert's valuable historic properties; termite assessments and treatments; and bee and wasp removal. Guest houses and self-catering cottages can access regular maintenance programmes. Many providers travel from Oudtshoorn or serve the broader Klein Karoo.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas — behind fridges, inside wall cavities, under sinks — where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats are neophobic and will avoid poorly placed traps. Scorpions require targeted treatment. Wood borer and termite treatments need specialised detection equipment and registered pesticides — particularly important for Prince Albert's irreplaceable historic buildings. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products and understand heritage property requirements.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, verified pest controllers serving Prince Albert receive your details. Given the town's remote location beyond the Swartberg, most providers come from Oudtshoorn (via Meiringspoort) or occasionally from the Great Karoo towns. Response times depend on provider availability. Expect questions about the type of pest, property age and heritage status, and any tourism business requirements. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. For Prince Albert's heritage buildings, ask about experience with historic properties — treatment methods should be effective without damaging valuable original features like yellowwood beams and reed ceilings. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness and professionalism. Ask about guarantee policies. Ensure they're qualified to issue wood borer certificates.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How much does pest control cost in Prince Albert?",
      "answer": "Prince Albert pest control prices include significant travel costs due to the town's remote location. General insect spray for a 3-bedroom home typically costs R800-R1,450. Rodent control programmes run R650-R1,200 initially plus R350-R500 for follow-ups. Wood borer certificates cost R1,500-R3,500 including treatment if required. Heritage properties with extensive original timber may require specialist assessment. Get multiple ProHub quotes to compare."

    {
      "question": "What pests are common in Prince Albert?",
      "answer": "Prince Albert's Karoo location creates specific pest populations. Most common are scorpions (several species including dangerous Parabuthus), spiders, and rodents seeking shelter from temperature extremes. Cockroaches and ants are present year-round. The irrigation furrows create localised mosquito habitats. Wood borers can affect historic timber — a serious concern for Prince Albert's heritage buildings. Cold winters drive rodents indoors, while summer heat brings increased insect activity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in Prince Albert?",
      "answer": "Yes, conveyancing attorneys require a wood borer certificate before property transfer. This is critically important in Prince Albert where historic homes feature irreplaceable original timber — yellowwood beams, Oregon pine floors, and traditional reed ceilings. A qualified pest inspector examines all timber components. Heritage properties may require more detailed inspection. Budget R1,500-R3,500 depending on property size and whether treatment is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I deal with scorpions at my Prince Albert property?",
      "answer": "Scorpions are a fact of life in Prince Albert's Karoo environment. Reduce habitats by clearing rock piles, woodstacks, and debris near buildings. Seal gaps under doors and around pipes — scorpions can squeeze through small spaces. Keep grass short and vegetation trimmed away from walls. Professional pest controllers can apply barrier treatments around property perimeters. Always check shoes, towels, and bedding. Seek medical attention if stung by larger scorpion species."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Prince Albert pest controllers offer emergency callouts?",
      "answer": "Emergency services are available but limited by Prince Albert's remote location. Most providers come from Oudtshoorn, about 60km away via Meiringspoort. Same-day service may be possible but isn't guaranteed. For urgent situations, mark your ProHub request as emergency. Weekend and after-hours callouts carry a premium of R250-R600. For severe scorpion problems or dangerous situations, response times are prioritised."
