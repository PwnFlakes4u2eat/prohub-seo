  "guideIntro": "Calitzdorp, the port wine capital of South Africa, is a charming Klein Karoo village where pest control considerations reflect its wine farming heritage and semi-arid climate. This small Route 62 town features historic Cape Dutch buildings, wine cellars, and residential properties that face distinct Karoo pest challenges. The hot, dry summers and cold winters influence seasonal pest patterns — scorpions and spiders thrive in the rocky terrain, while rodents are attracted to wine cellars and grape storage. Many properties are older, with original timber components that require careful monitoring for wood borers. ProHub connects Calitzdorp residents with verified pest controllers who understand the specific needs of this wine country community.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Calitzdorp pest control companies provide services suited to this wine-producing village. Core offerings include rodent control essential for wine cellars and grape storage facilities; comprehensive insect treatments for cockroaches, ants, and the scorpions and spiders common in the Karoo; specialised treatments to protect wine cellars from cork beetles and other wine-damaging insects; wood borer inspections and fumigation for historic buildings; termite assessments; and bee and wasp removal. Many providers serve the broader Klein Karoo region including Oudtshoorn and Ladismith.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. In a wine-producing area like Calitzdorp, using incorrect products near cellars can be disastrous. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats avoid poorly placed traps. Scorpions require targeted treatment. Wood borer and termite treatments need specialised equipment and registered pesticides. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products, know where pests hide, and understand wine industry requirements.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, verified pest controllers serving Calitzdorp receive your details. Given the village's small size, providers typically come from Oudtshoorn or Ladismith. Most respond within hours. Expect questions about the type of pest, severity of the problem, property size, and whether wine production facilities are involved. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. If you have wine cellars or produce port, ask about experience with wine industry pest control requirements. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness and professionalism. Ask about their guarantee policy. For wood borer certificates, ensure they're qualified to issue certificates recognised by conveyancing attorneys.",

    {
      "question": "What pests are common in Calitzdorp?",
      "answer": "Calitzdorp's Klein Karoo location creates specific pest populations. Most common are scorpions and spiders (thriving in the rocky, dry terrain), rodents attracted to wine cellars and grape storage, and various Karoo insects. Cork beetles can affect wine cellars. Cockroaches and ants are present year-round. The dry climate means fewer moisture-related pests than coastal areas. Winter drives rodents indoors seeking warmth."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in Calitzdorp?",
      "answer": "Yes, most conveyancing attorneys require a wood borer and beetle-free certificate before property transfer. This is important in Calitzdorp where historic Cape Dutch buildings often feature original timber components. A qualified pest inspector examines roof timbers, wooden floors, door frames, and furniture for signs of infestation. Budget R1,400-R3,200 depending on property size and whether treatment is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I protect my wine cellar from pests in Calitzdorp?",
      "answer": "Wine cellars require careful pest management. Rodents can damage cork, contaminate wine, and chew through equipment. Keep cellars clean, seal entry points, and install door sweeps. Professional pest controllers can set up monitored bait stations that are safe for food-adjacent areas. Cork beetles require specialised treatment. Regular inspections catch problems early. Ask about wine industry-specific pest programmes that many Klein Karoo providers offer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Calitzdorp pest controllers offer emergency callouts?",
      "answer": "Yes, pest control companies serving Calitzdorp offer emergency services, typically responding from Oudtshoorn or Ladismith. Same-day service is usually available for urgent situations like severe infestations or dangerous scorpion encounters. Weekend and after-hours callouts typically carry a premium of R200-R500. Mark your ProHub request as urgent for faster responses."
