  "guideIntro": "Hartenbos is synonymous with family beach holidays, and its pest control needs reflect this character. This popular seaside resort adjacent to Mossel Bay sees its population swell dramatically during school holidays, putting pressure on everything from plumbing to pest management. The Hartenbos Heuwels residential area and beachfront properties face different challenges — from the sand fleas and cockroaches that thrive in the coastal environment to the rodents attracted to holiday accommodation waste. Many Hartenbos properties are holiday flats and houses that stand empty for months, creating perfect conditions for pest infestations to take hold unnoticed. ProHub connects Hartenbos property owners with verified pest controllers who understand the seasonal rhythms of this family resort town.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Hartenbos pest control companies provide services suited to the resort town's needs. Core offerings include rodent control for holiday properties and the restaurants serving seasonal visitors; comprehensive insect treatments targeting cockroaches, ants, and the sand fleas common along the beach; wood borer inspections and fumigation for properties ranging from older beach cottages to modern apartments; termite assessments and soil treatments; bird control for seagulls affecting beachfront properties and commercial areas; and bee and wasp removal essential during the busy summer season. Many providers offer pre-season inspections and treatments timed for before the holiday rush.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas — behind fridges, inside wall cavities, under sinks — where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats are neophobic (fear new objects) and will avoid poorly placed traps for weeks. Wood borer and termite treatments require specialised detection equipment and registered pesticides that aren't available to consumers. For bee or wasp nests, attempting removal without proper protection risks serious stings and, for those with allergies, life-threatening reactions. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products, know exactly where pests hide, and provide certificates and guarantees on their work.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, up to 5 verified pest controllers serving Hartenbos receive your details. Many operate from nearby Mossel Bay or George. Most respond within hours — faster for urgent infestations. Expect questions about the type of pest, severity of the problem, property size, and whether it's a holiday let. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will need to conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing. Quotes should include the treatment method, products used, safety information, and any follow-up visits included.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness — did the pests actually stay gone? — and professionalism. Ask about their guarantee policy: reputable companies offer free follow-up treatments if pests return within a specified period. For holiday properties, ask about pre-season treatment packages. For wood borer certificates, ensure they're qualified to issue certificates recognised by conveyancing attorneys.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How much does pest control cost in Hartenbos?",
      "answer": "Hartenbos pest control prices align with the broader Mossel Bay area. General insect spray for a 3-bedroom home typically costs R750-R1,400. Rodent control programmes run R600-R1,200 initially plus R300-R500 for follow-ups. Wood borer certificates cost R1,500-R3,500 including treatment if required. Termite treatments range from R5,000-R25,000 depending on severity. Pre-season holiday property packages may offer better value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What pests are common in Hartenbos?",
      "answer": "Hartenbos's coastal location creates specific pest challenges. Most common are cockroaches (thriving in the seaside humidity, especially in holiday flats), sand fleas along the beach areas, rats and mice attracted to seasonal waste from holiday accommodation, and seagulls pestering beachfront properties. Wood borers affect older beach cottages. Ant invasions increase during summer, and wasps build nests under eaves of holiday homes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in Hartenbos?",
      "answer": "Yes, most conveyancing attorneys require a wood borer and beetle-free certificate before property transfer. A qualified pest inspector examines roof timbers, wooden floors, door frames, and furniture for signs of active infestation or previous damage. If treatment is needed, the property is fumigated and a clearance certificate issued. Budget R1,500-R3,500 depending on property size and whether treatment is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should I prepare my Hartenbos holiday property for the season?",
      "answer": "Schedule a pest inspection and treatment 2-4 weeks before the holiday season begins. This gives treatments time to work and ensures your property is pest-free for guests or family. Clear out old food, check for rodent droppings or cockroach signs, and repair any entry points. If the property has been closed for months, a thorough treatment is recommended. Many Hartenbos pest controllers offer pre-season packages at competitive rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Hartenbos pest controllers offer emergency callouts?",
      "answer": "Yes, pest control companies serving Hartenbos offer emergency services, particularly important during peak holiday season when a pest problem can disrupt family vacations. Weekend and after-hours callouts typically carry a premium of R200-R500. When submitting your ProHub request, mark it as urgent and describe the situation clearly to get faster responses from available providers."
