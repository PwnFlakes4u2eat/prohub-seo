  "guideIntro": "Oudtshoorn, the capital of the Klein Karoo, faces pest challenges shaped by its semi-arid climate and position as the region's commercial hub. The town's famous ostrich farming industry, tourism focused on the Cango Caves, and agricultural activities all influence local pest populations. From the historic CBD with its feather palace architecture to the townships of Bongolethu and Bridgton, properties experience different pest pressures — scorpions and spiders thrive in the dry Karoo climate, while rodents are attracted to farming operations and grain storage. The contrast between hot summers and cold winters affects seasonal pest patterns. ProHub connects Oudtshoorn residents and businesses with verified pest controllers who understand the Klein Karoo's unique environment.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Oudtshoorn pest control companies provide services suited to the Klein Karoo environment. Core offerings include rodent control essential for properties near ostrich farms and agricultural facilities; comprehensive insect treatments for cockroaches, ants, flies, and the scorpions and spiders common in semi-arid regions; wood borer inspections and fumigation for the town's historic buildings; termite detection and treatment; and bee and wasp nest removal. Commercial services extend to ostrich farms, the tourism industry, and restaurants along Baron van Reede Street. Some providers offer specialised treatments for Karoo-specific pests.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas — behind fridges, inside wall cavities, under sinks — where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats are neophobic (fear new objects) and will avoid poorly placed traps for weeks. Scorpions require targeted treatment approaches. Wood borer and termite treatments need specialised detection equipment and registered pesticides. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products, know exactly where pests hide, and provide certificates and guarantees on their work.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, up to 5 verified Oudtshoorn pest controllers receive your details. Most respond within hours — faster for urgent infestations. Expect questions about the type of pest (including Karoo-specific concerns like scorpions), severity of the problem, property size, and any agricultural connections. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will need to conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing. Quotes should include the treatment method, products used, and follow-up visits.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness — did the pests actually stay gone? — and professionalism. Ask about their guarantee policy: reputable companies offer free follow-up treatments if pests return within a specified period. For wood borer certificates, ensure they're qualified to issue certificates recognised by conveyancing attorneys. Experience with Karoo-specific pests is a plus.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How much does pest control cost in Oudtshoorn?",
      "answer": "Oudtshoorn pest control prices are competitive for the Klein Karoo. General insect spray for a 3-bedroom home typically costs R700-R1,300. Rodent control programmes run R600-R1,100 initially plus R300-R500 for follow-ups. Wood borer certificates cost R1,400-R3,200 including treatment if required. Termite treatments range from R5,000-R24,000 depending on severity. Specialised scorpion treatments may cost extra."
    },
    {
      "question": "What pests are common in Oudtshoorn?",
      "answer": "Oudtshoorn's semi-arid Klein Karoo climate creates distinct pest populations. Most common are scorpions (several species including the potentially dangerous Parabuthus), spiders, cockroaches, and various Karoo insects. Rodents are prevalent near ostrich farms and agricultural facilities. Flies increase during summer. The dry climate means fewer mosquitoes than coastal areas, but ants can be problematic. Winter sees increased rodent activity indoors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in Oudtshoorn?",
      "answer": "Yes, most conveyancing attorneys require a wood borer and beetle-free certificate before property transfer. This is particularly important for Oudtshoorn's many historic buildings featuring original timber components. A qualified pest inspector examines roof timbers, wooden floors, door frames, and furniture for signs of infestation. Budget R1,400-R3,200 depending on property size and whether treatment is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I deal with scorpions at my Oudtshoorn property?",
      "answer": "Scorpions are common in the Klein Karoo. Reduce habitats by removing rock piles, debris, and wood stacks near your home. Seal gaps under doors and around pipes — scorpions can squeeze through small spaces. Keep grass short and vegetation trimmed away from buildings. Professional pest controllers can apply barrier treatments around your property perimeter. Always check shoes and clothing stored in garages or outbuildings. If stung, seek medical attention for severe reactions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Oudtshoorn pest controllers offer emergency callouts?",
      "answer": "Yes, many Oudtshoorn pest control companies offer same-day or emergency services for urgent situations like severe infestations, dangerous scorpion encounters, or wasp nests. Weekend and after-hours callouts typically carry a premium of R200-R500. When submitting your ProHub request, mark it as urgent and describe the situation clearly to get faster responses from available providers."
