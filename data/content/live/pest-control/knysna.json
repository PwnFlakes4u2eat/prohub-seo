  "guideIntro": "Knysna's famous lagoon, indigenous forests, and humid coastal climate create a unique environment where pests thrive year-round. The town's mix of older character homes in areas like The Heads and Leisure Isle, newer developments in Hornlee and Concordia, and the bustling Waterfront precinct presents varied pest challenges. Moisture from the lagoon and surrounding wetlands contributes to wood borer activity in timber structures, while the thriving restaurant scene along the Quays attracts rodents. Holiday homes that stand empty for months provide perfect breeding grounds for cockroaches and spiders. ProHub connects Knysna residents with verified pest control professionals who understand the lagoon town's specific pest pressures and can respond quickly whether you're dealing with a wasp nest at your guest house or need a wood borer certificate for a property sale.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Knysna pest control companies provide services tailored to the town's coastal and forest environment. Core offerings include rodent control for the rats and mice that frequent restaurant areas and older properties; comprehensive insect treatments for cockroaches, ants, fleas, and the fish moths common in damp coastal homes; wood borer inspections and fumigation essential for Knysna's many timber-built and timber-roofed properties; termite assessments and soil treatments; bird proofing for the seagulls and pigeons problematic around the Waterfront and Thesen Islands; and bee and wasp removal — particularly important given Knysna's outdoor lifestyle and tourism focus. Many pest controllers also service the hospitality industry with HACCP-compliant programmes.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas — behind fridges, inside wall cavities, under sinks — where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats are neophobic (fear new objects) and will avoid poorly placed traps for weeks. Wood borer and termite treatments require specialised detection equipment and registered pesticides that aren't available to consumers. For bee or wasp nests, attempting removal without proper protection risks serious stings and, for those with allergies, life-threatening reactions. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products, know exactly where pests hide, and provide certificates and guarantees on their work.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, up to 5 verified Knysna pest controllers receive your details. Most respond within hours — faster for urgent infestations. Expect questions about the type of pest, severity of the problem, and property size. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will need to conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing. Quotes should include the treatment method, products used, safety information (especially important if you have children or pets), any certificates provided, and follow-up visits included. For ongoing pest management, many Knysna companies offer monthly or quarterly service contracts at reduced rates.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness — did the pests actually stay gone? — and professionalism. Ask about their guarantee policy: reputable companies offer free follow-up treatments if pests return within a specified period. For wood borer certificates, ensure they're qualified to issue certificates recognised by conveyancing attorneys. Companies that take time to explain the treatment process and provide aftercare instructions typically deliver better results than those offering suspiciously cheap quotes.",

    {
      "question": "What pests are common in Knysna?",
      "answer": "Knysna's humid lagoon environment supports diverse pest populations. Most common are cockroaches (thriving in the coastal dampness), rats and mice (especially around the Waterfront and restaurant areas), wood borers attacking roof timbers and furniture in older homes, and fish moths in cupboards. Wasps build nests in garden sheds and under eaves from spring through autumn. Seagulls and pigeons cause problems at commercial properties near the lagoon."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in Knysna?",
      "answer": "Yes, most conveyancing attorneys in Knysna require a wood borer and beetle-free certificate before property transfer. This is especially important in Knysna where many homes feature timber construction or exposed beams. A qualified pest inspector examines roof timbers, wooden floors, door frames, and furniture for signs of infestation. Budget R1,500-R3,500 depending on property size and whether treatment is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I keep rodents out of my Knysna property?",
      "answer": "Prevention is key for rodent control in Knysna. Seal gaps around pipes, under doors, and in walls — mice can squeeze through 6mm gaps. Store food in sealed containers, keep bins closed, and remove pet food at night. Properties near the lagoon or restaurants need extra vigilance. Trim vegetation away from buildings and clear clutter. For active infestations, professional baiting programmes are more effective than DIY traps."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Knysna pest controllers offer emergency callouts?",
      "answer": "Yes, many Knysna pest control companies offer same-day or emergency services for urgent situations like wasp nest discoveries, snake sightings, or severe infestations. This is particularly important for guest houses and holiday rentals during peak season. Weekend and after-hours callouts typically carry a premium of R200-R500. Mark your ProHub request as urgent for faster responses."
