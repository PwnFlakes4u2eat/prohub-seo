  "guideIntro": "Great Brak River offers a quieter alternative to its busier Garden Route neighbours, but its position at the mouth of the Great Brak River creates specific pest challenges. The tranquil lagoon and surrounding wetlands provide habitat for diverse wildlife — including the pests that come with waterside living. Glentana, Tergniet, and Great Brak Village each have their own character, from retirement properties to holiday cottages. The high humidity from the river and lagoon accelerates wood borer activity and creates ideal conditions for cockroaches. The mix of permanent residents and holiday homeowners means some properties receive year-round care while others sit empty for months. ProHub connects Great Brak River property owners with verified pest controllers who understand this riverside community.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Great Brak River pest control companies provide services suited to this lagoon-side community. Offerings include rodent control for properties along the river where rats and mice are common; comprehensive insect treatments for cockroaches, mosquitoes (prevalent near the water), ants, and household pests; wood borer inspections and fumigation important for the area's many timber-feature homes; termite assessments and soil treatments; and bee and wasp nest removal. Many pest controllers also service the nearby Glentana and Tergniet areas. Holiday home maintenance programmes help property owners manage pest control between visits.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas — behind fridges, inside wall cavities, under sinks — where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats are neophobic (fear new objects) and will avoid poorly placed traps for weeks. Wood borer and termite treatments require specialised detection equipment and registered pesticides that aren't available to consumers. For bee or wasp nests, attempting removal without proper protection risks serious stings and, for those with allergies, life-threatening reactions. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products, know exactly where pests hide, and provide certificates and guarantees on their work.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, up to 5 verified pest controllers serving Great Brak River receive your details. Many operate from nearby Mossel Bay or George. Most respond within hours — faster for urgent infestations. Expect questions about the type of pest, severity of the problem, property size, and proximity to the lagoon. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will need to conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing. Quotes should include the treatment method, products used, and any follow-up visits included.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness — did the pests actually stay gone? — and professionalism. Ask about their guarantee policy: reputable companies offer free follow-up treatments if pests return within a specified period. For wood borer certificates, ensure they're qualified to issue certificates recognised by conveyancing attorneys. Companies that take time to explain the treatment process and provide aftercare instructions typically deliver better results.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What pests are common in Great Brak River?",
      "answer": "Great Brak River's lagoon location creates specific pest pressures. Most common are cockroaches (thriving in the riverside humidity), mosquitoes near the water, rats and mice along the riverbanks and near properties, and wood borers in timber structures. The wetland environment supports diverse insect populations. Wasps build nests in garden sheds and under eaves during warmer months. Properties closer to the water may experience more pest activity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in Great Brak River?",
      "answer": "Yes, most conveyancing attorneys require a wood borer and beetle-free certificate before property transfer. A qualified pest inspector examines roof timbers, wooden floors, door frames, and furniture for signs of active infestation or previous damage. If treatment is needed, the property is fumigated and a clearance certificate issued. Budget R1,500-R3,500 depending on property size and whether treatment is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I control mosquitoes at my Great Brak River property?",
      "answer": "Living near water means mosquitoes are a reality. Reduce breeding sites by eliminating standing water in gutters, plant saucers, and unused containers. Professional mosquito treatments can significantly reduce populations around your property. Consider screens on windows and doors. Some pest controllers offer regular mosquito management programmes, particularly useful for properties close to the lagoon. Evening outdoor treatments before events can also provide temporary relief."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Great Brak River pest controllers offer emergency callouts?",
      "answer": "Yes, pest control companies serving Great Brak River offer emergency services, typically responding from Mossel Bay or George. Same-day service is usually available for urgent situations like wasp nests, snake sightings, or severe infestations. Weekend and after-hours callouts typically carry a premium of R200-R500. Mark your ProHub request as urgent for faster responses."
