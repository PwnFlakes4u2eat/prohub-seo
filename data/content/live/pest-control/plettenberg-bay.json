  "guideIntro": "Plettenberg Bay's status as a premier holiday destination means pest control is essential for both permanent residents and the many holiday homes and guest establishments that define this upmarket coastal town. The humid climate, proximity to indigenous forests, and seasonal influx of visitors create unique pest pressures. From the exclusive properties along Robberg and Beacon Isle to the residential areas of Keurbooms and New Horizons, pests don't discriminate by property value. Holiday homes that stand empty between visits become havens for cockroaches and rodents, while restaurants and hotels require constant vigilance. ProHub connects Plettenberg Bay property owners with verified pest controllers who understand the town's seasonal patterns and can maintain properties whether you're there year-round or visiting occasionally.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Plettenberg Bay pest control companies cater to both residential and tourism-focused businesses. Services include rodent control programmes essential for restaurants and holiday properties; comprehensive insect treatments targeting cockroaches, ants, fleas, and the mosquitoes common near the lagoon areas; wood borer inspections and fumigation for the town's many timber-accented properties; termite detection and soil treatments; bird proofing for commercial establishments and beachfront properties dealing with seagulls; and safe bee and wasp nest removal critical during peak holiday seasons. Many companies offer holiday home maintenance programmes, checking and treating properties between owner visits.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas — behind fridges, inside wall cavities, under sinks — where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats are neophobic (fear new objects) and will avoid poorly placed traps for weeks. Wood borer and termite treatments require specialised detection equipment and registered pesticides that aren't available to consumers. For bee or wasp nests, attempting removal without proper protection risks serious stings and, for those with allergies, life-threatening reactions. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products, know exactly where pests hide, and provide certificates and guarantees on their work.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, up to 5 verified Plettenberg Bay pest controllers receive your details. Most respond within hours — faster for urgent infestations. Expect questions about the type of pest, severity of the problem, and property size. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will need to conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing. Quotes should include the treatment method, products used, safety information (especially important if you have children or pets), any certificates provided, and follow-up visits included. For ongoing pest management, many Plett companies offer monthly or quarterly service contracts, including holiday home checks.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness — did the pests actually stay gone? — and professionalism. Ask about their guarantee policy: reputable companies offer free follow-up treatments if pests return within a specified period. For wood borer certificates, ensure they're qualified to issue certificates recognised by conveyancing attorneys. Companies that take time to explain the treatment process and provide aftercare instructions typically deliver better results than those offering suspiciously cheap quotes.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How much does pest control cost in Plettenberg Bay?",
      "answer": "Plettenberg Bay pest control prices vary by treatment type and property size. General insect spray for a 3-bedroom home typically costs R900-R1,700. Rodent control programmes run R700-R1,400 initially plus R350-R550 for follow-ups. Wood borer certificates cost R1,600-R3,800 including treatment if required. Termite treatments range from R5,500-R28,000 depending on severity. Prices may be slightly higher than neighbouring towns due to Plett's premium property market."
    },
    {
      "question": "What pests are common in Plettenberg Bay?",
      "answer": "Plettenberg Bay's humid coastal climate and forest surroundings support diverse pest populations. Most common are cockroaches (especially in holiday homes that stand empty), rats and mice attracted to restaurants and residential waste, wood borers in timber structures, and mosquitoes near the Keurbooms lagoon. Baboons occasionally invade properties seeking food. Wasps are active from spring through autumn, and fleas thrive in the sandy coastal environment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in Plettenberg Bay?",
      "answer": "Yes, most conveyancing attorneys in Plettenberg Bay require a wood borer and beetle-free certificate before property transfer. Given Plett's premium property values, this inspection is particularly important. A qualified pest inspector examines roof timbers, wooden floors, door frames, and furniture for signs of infestation. Budget R1,600-R3,800 depending on property size and whether treatment is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I maintain pest control at my Plettenberg Bay holiday home?",
      "answer": "Holiday homes require special attention. Before leaving, ensure all food is sealed or removed, bins are empty, and no water sources remain (fix drips, empty pet bowls). Many Plett pest controllers offer holiday home maintenance programmes — they'll inspect and treat your property between visits. Consider quarterly preventative treatments. Seal gaps around pipes and doors, and ask a neighbour or property manager to report any pest signs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Plettenberg Bay pest controllers offer emergency callouts?",
      "answer": "Yes, many Plettenberg Bay pest control companies offer same-day or emergency services — essential during peak holiday season when a pest problem can ruin a vacation. Weekend and after-hours callouts typically carry a premium of R250-R600. When submitting your ProHub request, mark it as urgent and describe the situation clearly to get faster responses from available providers."
