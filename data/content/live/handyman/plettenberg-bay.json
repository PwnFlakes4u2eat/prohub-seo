  "guideIntro": "Plettenberg Bay's reputation as a premier holiday destination means properties here work harder than most — holiday lets need constant turnover maintenance, beach houses battle salt spray, and those stunning Robberg views come with exposure to the elements. From the upmarket homes on Beacon Isle to the family residences in Keurbooms and the growing community of New Horizons, Plett properties demand regular attention. ProHub connects you with verified local handymen who understand the rhythm of this resort town. Whether you're preparing a holiday rental between bookings, maintaining your permanent residence, or managing property remotely from Johannesburg or Cape Town, having a trusted Plett handyman on call means peace of mind.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Plettenberg Bay handymen handle a broad spectrum of tasks that fall between DIY and specialist trades. Common jobs include furniture assembly (from Builders Warehouse flatpacks to online orders), door and window repairs, lock replacements, gutter cleaning and repairs, picture and TV mounting, shelving installation, minor carpentry, fence repairs, deck maintenance, and general home repairs. Many Plett handymen also offer painting touch-ups, pressure washing, basic tiling repairs, and property prep between holiday rentals. For the significant number of holiday homes in Robberg, Beacon Isle, and Keurbooms, handymen provide valuable seasonal maintenance, guest turnover repairs, and property management support.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "If you're handy with tools and have the time, simple jobs like hanging pictures or tightening hinges are perfectly manageable. But hiring a handyman often makes sense even for 'easy' tasks when you factor in your time, the risk of mistakes, and the cost of buying tools you'll use once. A professional handyman with a bakkie full of equipment can complete in two hours what might take you an entire weekend — plus trips to the hardware store. For anything structural, electrical, or involving plumbing beyond basic fixes, handymen will typically recommend you call a licensed specialist. A good Plettenberg Bay handyman knows their limits and won't risk your safety or their reputation on work outside their expertise.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a request through ProHub, describe your jobs in detail — handymen often work through a list of smaller tasks in a single visit, which is more cost-effective than multiple callouts. You'll typically receive quotes within hours from verified Plettenberg Bay handymen. Most charge either an hourly rate (R200-R450) or quote per job for larger tasks. For standard work, expect same-week availability; simpler jobs can often be scheduled within days. Good handymen bring their own tools and basic materials, though you'll usually need to supply specific items like paint colours, shelf brackets to match existing ones, or specialised fittings. Confirm what's included before work starts.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "The best Plettenberg Bay handymen build their reputation on reliability and quality workmanship. Check ProHub reviews for comments about punctuality, tidiness, and whether they completed work as quoted. Ask about their experience with your specific job type — an excellent furniture assembler isn't necessarily great at carpentry. Confirm they have public liability insurance, especially for work involving ladders or power tools. For ongoing property maintenance, many handymen offer discounted rates for regular clients or maintenance contracts. If they quote significantly below market rate, ask why — cheap often means cutting corners.",
