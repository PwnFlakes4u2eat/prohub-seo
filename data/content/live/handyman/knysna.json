  "guideIntro": "Living in Knysna means embracing the unique challenges of coastal property ownership — the salt air that rusts hinges, the humidity that warps wood, and the endless maintenance that lagoon-side living demands. From the charming cottages on Leisure Isle to the hillside homes overlooking The Heads, every Knysna property has its share of jobs waiting to be done. Holiday homes sit empty for months then need urgent attention before guests arrive, while permanent residents juggle work with that growing list of repairs. ProHub connects you with verified local handymen who understand Knysna's specific challenges — from treating timber against the coastal climate to securing properties in this fire-prone region. Whether you're a business owner at Knysna Quays, managing a rental in Hornlee, or maintaining your family home in Concordia, having a reliable handyman makes all the difference.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Knysna handymen handle a broad spectrum of tasks that fall between DIY and specialist trades. Common jobs include furniture assembly (from Builders Warehouse flatpacks to online orders), door and window repairs, lock replacements, gutter cleaning and repairs, picture and TV mounting, shelving installation, minor carpentry, fence repairs, deck maintenance, and general home repairs. Many Knysna handymen also offer painting touch-ups, pressure washing, basic tiling repairs, and pre-sale property prep. For the many holiday homes around the lagoon and Leisure Isle, handymen provide valuable seasonal check-ups, opening and closing properties, and addressing issues between visits. Salt air corrosion repairs are particularly common in this coastal town.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "If you're handy with tools and have the time, simple jobs like hanging pictures or tightening hinges are perfectly manageable. But hiring a handyman often makes sense even for 'easy' tasks when you factor in your time, the risk of mistakes, and the cost of buying tools you'll use once. A professional handyman with a bakkie full of equipment can complete in two hours what might take you an entire weekend — plus trips to the hardware store. For anything structural, electrical, or involving plumbing beyond basic fixes, handymen will typically recommend you call a licensed specialist. A good Knysna handyman knows their limits and won't risk your safety or their reputation on work outside their expertise.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a request through ProHub, describe your jobs in detail — handymen often work through a list of smaller tasks in a single visit, which is more cost-effective than multiple callouts. You'll typically receive quotes within hours from verified Knysna handymen. Most charge either an hourly rate (R200-R450) or quote per job for larger tasks. For standard work, expect same-week availability; simpler jobs can often be scheduled within days. Good handymen bring their own tools and basic materials, though you'll usually need to supply specific items like paint colours, shelf brackets to match existing ones, or specialised fittings. Confirm what's included before work starts.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "The best Knysna handymen build their reputation on reliability and quality workmanship. Check ProHub reviews for comments about punctuality, tidiness, and whether they completed work as quoted. Ask about their experience with your specific job type — an excellent furniture assembler isn't necessarily great at carpentry. Confirm they have public liability insurance, especially for work involving ladders or power tools. For ongoing property maintenance, many handymen offer discounted rates for regular clients or maintenance contracts. If they quote significantly below market rate, ask why — cheap often means cutting corners.",
