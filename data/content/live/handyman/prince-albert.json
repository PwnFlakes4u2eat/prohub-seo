  "guideIntro": "Prince Albert is the jewel of the Klein Karoo — a beautifully preserved village where whitewashed Cape Dutch homes line quiet streets beneath the dramatic Swartberg mountains. Famous for figs, olives, and the spectacular Swartberg Pass, Prince Albert has attracted artists, writers, and weekend escapees who've restored historic properties with care. But these heritage buildings need ongoing maintenance, and the Karoo climate — scorching summers, cold winters, and ever-present dust — doesn't make it easy. ProHub connects you with verified handymen who understand Prince Albert's special character. Whether you're maintaining a historic cottage in the village, keeping a guesthouse welcoming, or looking after your Karoo retreat, a skilled handyman who respects heritage is invaluable.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Prince Albert handymen handle a broad spectrum of tasks that fall between DIY and specialist trades. Common jobs include furniture assembly (from Builders Warehouse flatpacks to online orders), door and window repairs, lock replacements, gutter cleaning and repairs, picture and TV mounting, shelving installation, minor carpentry, fence repairs, deck maintenance, and general home repairs. Many Prince Albert handymen also offer painting touch-ups, pressure washing, basic tiling repairs, and heritage-sensitive work on older buildings. Given the tourism and guesthouse economy, handymen here frequently help with property prep between guests and seasonal maintenance.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "If you're handy with tools and have the time, simple jobs like hanging pictures or tightening hinges are perfectly manageable. But hiring a handyman often makes sense even for 'easy' tasks when you factor in your time, the risk of mistakes, and the cost of buying tools you'll use once. A professional handyman with a bakkie full of equipment can complete in two hours what might take you an entire weekend — plus trips to the hardware store in Oudtshoorn via the mountain pass. For anything structural, electrical, or involving plumbing beyond basic fixes, handymen will typically recommend you call a licensed specialist. A good Prince Albert handyman knows their limits and won't risk your safety or their reputation on work outside their expertise.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a request through ProHub, describe your jobs in detail — handymen often work through a list of smaller tasks in a single visit, which is more cost-effective than multiple callouts. You'll typically receive quotes from verified handymen servicing Prince Albert. Most charge either an hourly rate (R200-R450) or quote per job for larger tasks. For standard work, expect same-week availability; simpler jobs can often be scheduled within days. Good handymen bring their own tools and basic materials, though you'll usually need to supply specific items like paint colours, shelf brackets to match existing ones, or specialised fittings. Confirm what's included before work starts.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "The best handymen servicing Prince Albert build their reputation on reliability and quality workmanship. Check ProHub reviews for comments about punctuality, tidiness, and whether they completed work as quoted. Ask about their experience with your specific job type — an excellent furniture assembler isn't necessarily great at carpentry. Confirm they have public liability insurance, especially for work involving ladders or power tools. For ongoing property maintenance, many handymen offer discounted rates for regular clients or maintenance contracts. If they quote significantly below market rate, ask why — cheap often means cutting corners.",
