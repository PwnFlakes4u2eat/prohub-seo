  "guideIntro": "De Rust — the gateway to spectacular Meiringspoort — is a charming Klein Karoo village where Victorian architecture meets the dramatic Swartberg mountains. This small community has attracted artists, guesthouse owners, and those seeking Karoo tranquility, resulting in beautifully maintained historic homes alongside working farms. Properties here face the classic Karoo challenges: intense summer heat, cold winter nights, and dust carried on the wind. ProHub connects you with verified handymen who appreciate De Rust's heritage character while delivering practical repairs. Whether you're maintaining a Victorian cottage in the village, keeping a guesthouse welcoming for Meiringspoort visitors, or looking after a rural retreat, a skilled handyman is essential.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "De Rust handymen handle a broad spectrum of tasks that fall between DIY and specialist trades. Common jobs include furniture assembly (from Builders Warehouse flatpacks to online orders), door and window repairs, lock replacements, gutter cleaning and repairs, picture and TV mounting, shelving installation, minor carpentry, fence repairs, deck maintenance, and general home repairs. Many De Rust handymen also offer painting touch-ups, pressure washing, basic tiling repairs, and heritage-sensitive work on older buildings. With tourism important to the local economy, handymen here often help with guesthouse maintenance and property prep between visitors.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "If you're handy with tools and have the time, simple jobs like hanging pictures or tightening hinges are perfectly manageable. But hiring a handyman often makes sense even for 'easy' tasks when you factor in your time, the risk of mistakes, and the cost of buying tools you'll use once. A professional handyman with a bakkie full of equipment can complete in two hours what might take you an entire weekend — plus trips to the hardware store in Oudtshoorn. For anything structural, electrical, or involving plumbing beyond basic fixes, handymen will typically recommend you call a licensed specialist. A good De Rust handyman knows their limits and won't risk your safety or their reputation on work outside their expertise.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a request through ProHub, describe your jobs in detail — handymen often work through a list of smaller tasks in a single visit, which is more cost-effective than multiple callouts. You'll typically receive quotes from verified handymen servicing De Rust. Most charge either an hourly rate (R200-R450) or quote per job for larger tasks. For standard work, expect same-week availability; simpler jobs can often be scheduled within days. Good handymen bring their own tools and basic materials, though you'll usually need to supply specific items like paint colours, shelf brackets to match existing ones, or specialised fittings. Confirm what's included before work starts.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "The best handymen servicing De Rust build their reputation on reliability and quality workmanship. Check ProHub reviews for comments about punctuality, tidiness, and whether they completed work as quoted. Ask about their experience with your specific job type — an excellent furniture assembler isn't necessarily great at carpentry. Confirm they have public liability insurance, especially for work involving ladders or power tools. For ongoing property maintenance, many handymen offer discounted rates for regular clients or maintenance contracts. If they quote significantly below market rate, ask why — cheap often means cutting corners.",
