  "guideIntro": "George homeowners know the never-ending list of small jobs that pile up — the loose door handle that's been annoying you for months, the shelves you bought but never installed, the fence that's looking worse every winter. From the older character homes in Denneoord to the modern complexes in Heatherlands, every property has maintenance needs that don't quite justify calling a specialist tradesman. That's where a reliable George handyman becomes invaluable. ProHub connects you with verified local handymen who can tackle that growing to-do list efficiently and affordably. Whether you're a busy professional in the CBD, a holiday home owner checking in from Cape Town, or a landlord managing rentals in Pacaltsdorp, having a trusted handyman on speed dial makes property ownership significantly easier.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "George handymen handle a broad spectrum of tasks that fall between DIY and specialist trades. Common jobs include furniture assembly (from Builders Warehouse flatpacks to IKEA orders), door and window repairs, lock replacements, gutter cleaning and repairs, picture and TV mounting, shelving installation, minor carpentry, fence repairs, deck maintenance, and general home repairs. Many George handymen also offer painting touch-ups, pressure washing, basic tiling repairs, and pre-sale property prep — getting homes ready for viewings on short notice. For holiday homes along Herolds Bay and Victoria Bay, handymen provide valuable seasonal check-ups, opening and closing properties, and addressing issues between visits.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "If you're handy with tools and have the time, simple jobs like hanging pictures or tightening hinges are perfectly manageable. But hiring a handyman often makes sense even for 'easy' tasks when you factor in your time, the risk of mistakes, and the cost of buying tools you'll use once. A professional handyman with a bakkie full of equipment can complete in two hours what might take you an entire weekend — plus trips to the hardware store. For anything structural, electrical, or involving plumbing beyond basic fixes, handymen will typically recommend you call a licensed specialist. A good George handyman knows their limits and won't risk your safety or their reputation on work outside their expertise.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a request through ProHub, describe your jobs in detail — handymen often work through a list of smaller tasks in a single visit, which is more cost-effective than multiple callouts. You'll typically receive quotes within hours from verified George handymen. Most charge either an hourly rate (R200-R450) or quote per job for larger tasks. For standard work, expect same-week availability; simpler jobs can often be scheduled within days. Good handymen bring their own tools and basic materials, though you'll usually need to supply specific items like paint colours, shelf brackets to match existing ones, or specialised fittings. Confirm what's included before work starts.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "The best George handymen build their reputation on reliability and quality workmanship. Check ProHub reviews for comments about punctuality, tidiness, and whether they completed work as quoted. Ask about their experience with your specific job type — an excellent furniture assembler isn't necessarily great at carpentry. Confirm they have public liability insurance, especially for work involving ladders or power tools. For ongoing property maintenance, many handymen offer discounted rates for regular clients or maintenance contracts. If they quote significantly below market rate, ask why — cheap often means cutting corners.",
