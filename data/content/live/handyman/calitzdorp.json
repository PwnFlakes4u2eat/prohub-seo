  "guideIntro": "Calitzdorp — South Africa's port wine capital — is a small Klein Karoo gem where vineyards meet Victorian architecture. This Route 62 village has seen growing interest from wine tourists and city escapees, but it remains an authentic working agricultural town. Properties range from historic homes in Calitzdorp Village to wine farm buildings and modern holiday cottages. The dry climate and extreme temperature variations test buildings, while older structures often need sensitive maintenance. ProHub connects you with verified handymen who can handle both historic restoration and everyday repairs. Whether you're maintaining a guesthouse, keeping wine cellar buildings functional, or looking after your Karoo retreat, a capable handyman is invaluable.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Calitzdorp handymen handle a broad spectrum of tasks that fall between DIY and specialist trades. Common jobs include furniture assembly (from Builders Warehouse flatpacks to online orders), door and window repairs, lock replacements, gutter cleaning and repairs, picture and TV mounting, shelving installation, minor carpentry, fence repairs, deck maintenance, and general home repairs. Many Calitzdorp handymen also offer painting touch-ups, pressure washing, basic tiling repairs, and work on older buildings with thick clay walls. Given the wine industry presence, handymen here often assist with tasting room setups, cellar door maintenance, and guest accommodation prep.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "If you're handy with tools and have the time, simple jobs like hanging pictures or tightening hinges are perfectly manageable. But hiring a handyman often makes sense even for 'easy' tasks when you factor in your time, the risk of mistakes, and the cost of buying tools you'll use once. A professional handyman with a bakkie full of equipment can complete in two hours what might take you an entire weekend — plus trips to the hardware store in Oudtshoorn. For anything structural, electrical, or involving plumbing beyond basic fixes, handymen will typically recommend you call a licensed specialist. A good Calitzdorp handyman knows their limits and won't risk your safety or their reputation on work outside their expertise.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a request through ProHub, describe your jobs in detail — handymen often work through a list of smaller tasks in a single visit, which is more cost-effective than multiple callouts. You'll typically receive quotes from verified handymen servicing Calitzdorp. Most charge either an hourly rate (R200-R450) or quote per job for larger tasks. For standard work, expect same-week availability; simpler jobs can often be scheduled within days. Good handymen bring their own tools and basic materials, though you'll usually need to supply specific items like paint colours, shelf brackets to match existing ones, or specialised fittings. Confirm what's included before work starts.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "The best handymen servicing Calitzdorp build their reputation on reliability and quality workmanship. Check ProHub reviews for comments about punctuality, tidiness, and whether they completed work as quoted. Ask about their experience with your specific job type — an excellent furniture assembler isn't necessarily great at carpentry. Confirm they have public liability insurance, especially for work involving ladders or power tools. For ongoing property maintenance, many handymen offer discounted rates for regular clients or maintenance contracts. If they quote significantly below market rate, ask why — cheap often means cutting corners.",
