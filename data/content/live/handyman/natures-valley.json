  "guideIntro": "Nature's Valley is truly one of a kind — a tiny village nestled between the Tsitsikamma forest and the sea, surrounded entirely by national park. This isolation is its magic, but it also means property maintenance requires planning. There's no hardware store around the corner, and the forest humidity, salt air, and abundant wildlife create unique challenges for homeowners. Most properties here are holiday homes or retreats, standing empty between visits but exposed year-round to nature's elements. ProHub connects you with handymen who service this special community. Whether you're preparing your cottage for a family visit, dealing with baboon-proofing repairs, or maintaining your slice of paradise from Plettenberg Bay, a reliable handyman is essential.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Nature's Valley handymen handle a broad spectrum of tasks that fall between DIY and specialist trades. Common jobs include furniture assembly, door and window repairs (wildlife-proofing is especially important here), lock replacements, gutter cleaning and repairs, picture and TV mounting, shelving installation, minor carpentry, fence repairs, deck maintenance, and general home repairs. Many handymen also offer painting touch-ups, pressure washing, basic tiling repairs, and seasonal property prep. Given the location, baboon-proofing, timber treatment against the humid forest climate, and storm damage repairs are frequent requests.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "If you're handy with tools and have the time, simple jobs like hanging pictures or tightening hinges are perfectly manageable. But in Nature's Valley, hiring a handyman often makes even more sense — there's no nearby hardware store if you're missing a part, and getting materials requires a trip to Plett. A professional handyman arrives with a bakkie full of supplies and can complete in two hours what might take you an entire weekend of back-and-forth. For anything structural, electrical, or involving plumbing beyond basic fixes, handymen will recommend licensed specialists. A good Nature's Valley handyman knows their limits and won't risk your safety or their reputation on work outside their expertise.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a request through ProHub, describe your jobs in detail — handymen often work through a list of smaller tasks in a single visit, which is especially cost-effective in Nature's Valley given travel distances. You'll typically receive quotes from handymen servicing this area. Most charge either an hourly rate (R200-R450) or quote per job, with travel time often factored in for this remote location. Good handymen bring their own tools and basic materials, though you'll usually need to supply specific items. Confirm what's included and any travel fees before work starts.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "The best handymen servicing Nature's Valley build their reputation on reliability and quality workmanship. Check ProHub reviews for comments about punctuality, tidiness, and whether they completed work as quoted. Ask about their experience with your specific job type — an excellent furniture assembler isn't necessarily great at carpentry. Confirm they have public liability insurance, especially for work involving ladders or power tools. For ongoing property maintenance, many handymen offer maintenance contracts ideal for absentee owners. If they quote significantly below market rate, ask why — cheap often means cutting corners.",
