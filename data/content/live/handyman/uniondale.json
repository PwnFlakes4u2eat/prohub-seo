  "guideIntro": "Uniondale occupies a unique position — historically connecting the Garden Route to the Karoo interior, this farming town sits where the lush coastal climate meets the drier Klein Karoo. Properties here reflect generations of agricultural life, from historic homesteads to practical farm buildings. The climate swings between cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers, testing buildings in every season. ProHub connects you with verified handymen who understand the needs of Uniondale properties. Whether you're maintaining a family home in Uniondale Town, keeping farmhouse and outbuildings functional, or preparing a property for the next generation, a skilled handyman makes rural property ownership easier.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Uniondale handymen handle a broad spectrum of tasks that fall between DIY and specialist trades. Common jobs include furniture assembly (from Builders Warehouse flatpacks to online orders), door and window repairs, lock replacements, gutter cleaning and repairs, picture and TV mounting, shelving installation, minor carpentry, fence repairs, deck maintenance, and general home repairs. Many Uniondale handymen also offer painting touch-ups, pressure washing, basic tiling repairs, and weatherproofing. Given the agricultural setting, handymen here often have experience with farm building repairs, older construction methods, and the robust maintenance that rural properties require.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "If you're handy with tools and have the time, simple jobs like hanging pictures or tightening hinges are perfectly manageable. But hiring a handyman often makes sense even for 'easy' tasks when you factor in your time, the risk of mistakes, and the cost of buying tools you'll use once. A professional handyman with a bakkie full of equipment can complete in two hours what might take you an entire weekend — plus trips to the hardware store in George. For anything structural, electrical, or involving plumbing beyond basic fixes, handymen will typically recommend you call a licensed specialist. A good Uniondale handyman knows their limits and won't risk your safety or their reputation on work outside their expertise.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a request through ProHub, describe your jobs in detail — handymen often work through a list of smaller tasks in a single visit, which is especially cost-effective given distances in this area. You'll typically receive quotes from verified handymen servicing Uniondale. Most charge either an hourly rate (R200-R450) or quote per job for larger tasks. For standard work, expect same-week availability; simpler jobs can often be scheduled within days. Good handymen bring their own tools and basic materials, though you'll usually need to supply specific items. Confirm what's included and any travel fees before work starts.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "The best handymen servicing Uniondale build their reputation on reliability and quality workmanship. Check ProHub reviews for comments about punctuality, tidiness, and whether they completed work as quoted. Ask about their experience with your specific job type — an excellent furniture assembler isn't necessarily great at carpentry. Confirm they have public liability insurance, especially for work involving ladders or power tools. For ongoing property maintenance, many handymen offer discounted rates for regular clients or maintenance contracts. If they quote significantly below market rate, ask why — cheap often means cutting corners.",
