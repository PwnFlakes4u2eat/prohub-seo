  "guideIntro": "Mossel Bay's year-round mild climate makes it one of the most liveable towns on the Garden Route — but that doesn't mean properties maintain themselves. From the historic homes near Dias Beach to the newer developments at Pinnacle Point, every Mossel Bay property accumulates its share of repairs and odd jobs. The coastal wind carries salt that corrodes metal fittings, the sun fades paintwork, and those beautiful sea views come with maintenance demands. ProHub connects you with verified local handymen who know Mossel Bay inside out. Whether you're managing a holiday let in Dana Bay, keeping up an investment property in KwaNonqaba, or tackling the to-do list at your family home near the harbour, a reliable handyman turns weekend stress into a quick phone call.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Mossel Bay handymen handle a broad spectrum of tasks that fall between DIY and specialist trades. Common jobs include furniture assembly (from Builders Warehouse flatpacks to online orders), door and window repairs, lock replacements, gutter cleaning and repairs, picture and TV mounting, shelving installation, minor carpentry, fence repairs, deck maintenance, and general home repairs. Many Mossel Bay handymen also offer painting touch-ups, pressure washing, basic tiling repairs, and pre-sale property prep. For holiday properties around Dana Bay and Pinnacle Point, handymen provide valuable seasonal check-ups and between-let maintenance. Corrosion repairs and weatherproofing are especially popular in this coastal town.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "If you're handy with tools and have the time, simple jobs like hanging pictures or tightening hinges are perfectly manageable. But hiring a handyman often makes sense even for 'easy' tasks when you factor in your time, the risk of mistakes, and the cost of buying tools you'll use once. A professional handyman with a bakkie full of equipment can complete in two hours what might take you an entire weekend — plus trips to the hardware store. For anything structural, electrical, or involving plumbing beyond basic fixes, handymen will typically recommend you call a licensed specialist. A good Mossel Bay handyman knows their limits and won't risk your safety or their reputation on work outside their expertise.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a request through ProHub, describe your jobs in detail — handymen often work through a list of smaller tasks in a single visit, which is more cost-effective than multiple callouts. You'll typically receive quotes within hours from verified Mossel Bay handymen. Most charge either an hourly rate (R200-R450) or quote per job for larger tasks. For standard work, expect same-week availability; simpler jobs can often be scheduled within days. Good handymen bring their own tools and basic materials, though you'll usually need to supply specific items like paint colours, shelf brackets to match existing ones, or specialised fittings. Confirm what's included before work starts.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "The best Mossel Bay handymen build their reputation on reliability and quality workmanship. Check ProHub reviews for comments about punctuality, tidiness, and whether they completed work as quoted. Ask about their experience with your specific job type — an excellent furniture assembler isn't necessarily great at carpentry. Confirm they have public liability insurance, especially for work involving ladders or power tools. For ongoing property maintenance, many handymen offer discounted rates for regular clients or maintenance contracts. If they quote significantly below market rate, ask why — cheap often means cutting corners.",
