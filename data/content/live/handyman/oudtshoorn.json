  "guideIntro": "Oudtshoorn — the capital of the Klein Karoo — combines a rich history with a thriving tourism industry. The ostrich feather boom left behind magnificent 'feather palaces' that now need careful maintenance, while modern homes face the challenges of a semi-arid climate: extreme summer heat, cold winters, and dust that gets into everything. From the historic buildings in the CBD to the established neighbourhoods of Bridgton and Bongolethu, and the nearby community of Dysselsdorp, Oudtshoorn properties demand regular attention. ProHub connects you with verified local handymen who understand the Klein Karoo climate. Whether you're maintaining a guesthouse for Cango Caves visitors, keeping an ostrich farm's buildings functional, or tackling the to-do list at your family home, a reliable handyman is essential.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Oudtshoorn handymen handle a broad spectrum of tasks that fall between DIY and specialist trades. Common jobs include furniture assembly (from Builders Warehouse flatpacks to online orders), door and window repairs, lock replacements, gutter cleaning and repairs, picture and TV mounting, shelving installation, minor carpentry, fence repairs, deck maintenance, and general home repairs. Many Oudtshoorn handymen also offer painting touch-ups, pressure washing, basic tiling repairs, and property prep for the tourism season. Given the dry, dusty climate, weatherproofing, sealing, and repairs to older buildings with thick walls and wooden beams are common requests.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "If you're handy with tools and have the time, simple jobs like hanging pictures or tightening hinges are perfectly manageable. But hiring a handyman often makes sense even for 'easy' tasks when you factor in your time, the risk of mistakes, and the cost of buying tools you'll use once. A professional handyman with a bakkie full of equipment can complete in two hours what might take you an entire weekend — plus trips to the hardware store. For anything structural, electrical, or involving plumbing beyond basic fixes, handymen will typically recommend you call a licensed specialist. A good Oudtshoorn handyman knows their limits and won't risk your safety or their reputation on work outside their expertise.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a request through ProHub, describe your jobs in detail — handymen often work through a list of smaller tasks in a single visit, which is more cost-effective than multiple callouts. You'll typically receive quotes within hours from verified Oudtshoorn handymen. Most charge either an hourly rate (R200-R450) or quote per job for larger tasks. For standard work, expect same-week availability; simpler jobs can often be scheduled within days. Good handymen bring their own tools and basic materials, though you'll usually need to supply specific items like paint colours, shelf brackets to match existing ones, or specialised fittings. Confirm what's included before work starts.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "The best Oudtshoorn handymen build their reputation on reliability and quality workmanship. Check ProHub reviews for comments about punctuality, tidiness, and whether they completed work as quoted. Ask about their experience with your specific job type — an excellent furniture assembler isn't necessarily great at carpentry. Confirm they have public liability insurance, especially for work involving ladders or power tools. For ongoing property maintenance, many handymen offer discounted rates for regular clients or maintenance contracts. If they quote significantly below market rate, ask why — cheap often means cutting corners.",
