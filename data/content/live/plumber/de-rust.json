  "guideIntro": "De Rust guards the entrance to the spectacular Meiringspoort pass, a small Karoo village that serves as a gateway between the Klein Karoo and the Garden Route coast. The town's strategic location means passing traffic, but its small size means limited local services — including plumbing. Properties here face classic Karoo challenges: extreme temperature swings, hard borehole water, and the need for water storage given irregular supply. From the historic buildings on the main road to the farms stretching toward the Swartberg mountains, De Rust needs plumbers who can work independently in this remote environment. ProHub connects De Rust residents with verified plumbers experienced in small Karoo town requirements.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "De Rust plumbers handle the full range of Karoo requirements. Services include borehole pump installation and maintenance, water storage systems (JoJo tanks and cement reservoirs), solar geyser installations taking advantage of the region's sunshine, and thermal protection for extreme temperature swings. The town's older buildings need sensitive restoration work that respects heritage while improving function. For the surrounding farms, larger-scale agricultural plumbing, irrigation systems, and multiple borehole management are common. Standard services cover leak repairs, drain unblocking, and bathroom renovations suited to the local climate.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "De Rust's remoteness makes getting plumbing right the first time especially important. A DIY mistake that needs parts from Oudtshoorn (45 minutes away) or George (over the pass) means significant delays. Borehole systems, which most properties rely on, involve pumps and controls requiring specialist knowledge — improper work can burn out expensive equipment or contaminate water supplies. The extreme temperature range also demands proper materials and installation techniques. For anything beyond basic tap maintenance, professional expertise saves time and money.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Submit your request through ProHub and plumbers serving De Rust receive your job details. Most plumbers travel from Oudtshoorn (30-45 minutes), though some work the broader Klein Karoo region. Emergency response times reflect this — expect 45-90 minutes for urgent callouts. Standard quotes typically arrive within a day. Plumbers familiar with De Rust understand the importance of bringing comprehensive parts supplies to avoid return trips. For larger jobs, expect site visits and detailed assessments before final quotes.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "De Rust requires plumbers comfortable with remote, self-reliant work. When reviewing ProHub quotes, ask about experience in small Karoo towns, borehole system expertise, and familiarity with the specific challenges of the area. Reviews from other Klein Karoo properties indicate relevant experience. Check that plumbers carry adequate parts inventory for common issues. PIRB registration confirms professional standards, but practical Karoo experience is equally valuable.",

    {

      "answer": "De Rust plumber rates typically range from R350-R550 per hour, plus travel charges from Oudtshoorn (R250-R400).

    {
      "question": "How quickly can plumbers reach De Rust for emergencies?",
      "answer": "Most plumbers serving De Rust are based in Oudtshoorn (30-45 minutes away). Emergency response typically takes 45-90 minutes including mobilisation. For critical situations like burst mains or complete water loss, this response time is manageable. Less urgent issues can usually be scheduled for the next available appointment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do De Rust plumbers work on borehole systems?",
      "answer": "Yes, borehole expertise is essential for plumbers serving the Klein Karoo. Services include pump installation, pressure tank systems, water quality testing, filtration for mineral-heavy water, and connecting boreholes to household systems. Specify your borehole details when requesting ProHub quotes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes hard water problems in De Rust?",
      "answer": "De Rust's borehole water typically has high mineral content, primarily calcium and magnesium. This hard water causes scale buildup in pipes, geysers, kettles, and appliances. Signs include white deposits on taps, reduced water heater efficiency, and spotted dishes. Local plumbers install water softeners and recommend regular descaling maintenance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which areas do De Rust plumbers service?",
      "answer": "ProHub plumbers cover De Rust and surrounding farms toward the Swartberg mountains and Meiringspoort. Most also service Oudtshoorn, Calitzdorp, and the broader Klein Karoo region. Confirm coverage and travel fees when requesting quotes, especially for remote farm properties."
