  "guideIntro": "Stilbaai (Still Bay) is a charming fishing town on the Goukou River estuary, known for its remarkable fish traps — ancient stone structures in the bay — and its popularity as a quiet holiday destination. The town's character is distinctly coastal, with salt air corrosion affecting plumbing, seasonal population swings stressing systems, and many properties serving as holiday homes that sit empty for months. Skulpiesbaai and Jongensfontein extend the coastal area, while the estuary creates its own drainage and water table considerations. ProHub connects Stilbaai residents with verified plumbers who understand the specific demands of this river-mouth coastal environment.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Stilbaai plumbers handle the challenges of coastal estuary living. Services include corrosion-resistant installations using marine-grade fittings, drainage systems designed for the river-influenced water table, geyser repairs and replacements (salt air shortens geyser lifespan), and holiday home maintenance packages. For the fishing community, plumbers handle boat and marina plumbing requirements. Seasonal services include pre-holiday inspections to ensure homes are ready for occupants, and winterisation to protect properties sitting empty. Standard residential services cover drain unblocking, leak detection, tap and toilet repairs, and bathroom renovations.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Stilbaai's coastal environment accelerates plumbing wear in ways that aren't always visible. Salt corrosion works from the inside of fittings, meaning that tap that looks fine might fail completely when disturbed. The estuary's influence on groundwater creates drainage complexities that require local knowledge. For holiday homeowners especially, professional plumbing ensures properties are properly maintained during absences — a small leak left unattended becomes water damage discovered months later. Leave significant work to plumbers who know coastal conditions.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you request quotes through ProHub, plumbers serving Stilbaai receive your job details. Most plumbers are based locally or travel from Riversdale or Heidelberg (20-30 minutes). Emergency response is typically same-day, with quicker response from local plumbers. Standard quotes arrive within hours. Good Stilbaai plumbers understand holiday home realities — the urgency when owners arrive to find problems, the need for thorough work that survives months of vacancy, and the importance of accessible communication for absent owners.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Stilbaai requires plumbers experienced with coastal and estuary conditions. When reviewing ProHub quotes, ask about experience with salt corrosion, marine-grade materials, and holiday home management. Reviews from other Stilbaai or coastal properties indicate relevant experience. For holiday homes, look for plumbers offering maintenance contracts and pre-arrival inspection services. Check responsiveness — you need someone who'll answer when you're calling from Johannesburg about a burst pipe.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does salt air affect plumbing in Stilbaai?",
      "answer": "Salt air accelerates corrosion in copper pipes, steel fittings, and even some stainless grades. Stilbaai's direct coastal exposure means properties experience faster wear than inland areas. Signs include greenish deposits on copper, rust around fittings, and unexplained pinhole leaks. Local plumbers recommend marine-grade fittings and more frequent inspections."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the estuary affect plumbing in Stilbaai?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Goukou River estuary influences Stilbaai's water table, particularly for properties near the river. High tides can affect drainage efficiency, and groundwater may be brackish in some areas. Plumbers familiar with the town design drainage systems that function across tidal conditions and recommend appropriate materials for estuary exposure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which areas do Stilbaai plumbers service?",
      "answer": "ProHub plumbers cover Stilbaai, Skulpiesbaai, and Jongensfontein. Most also service Riversdale, Heidelberg, and Albertinia. Confirm coverage and any travel fees when requesting quotes. Some plumbers specialize in the coastal strip, while others cover the broader agricultural area."
