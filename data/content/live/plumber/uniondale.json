  "guideIntro": "Uniondale sits at the crossroads of the Long Kloof and the road to Knysna, a small farming town serving the surrounding agricultural community. The town itself is compact, but the plumbing service area extends across vast sheep and fruit farms in all directions. Properties here face classic Karoo challenges — reliance on boreholes, extreme temperature variations, and the need for self-sufficient water systems given the distance from major centres. The town's older buildings add heritage considerations, while farms need plumbers comfortable with agricultural systems and long travel distances. ProHub connects Uniondale residents with verified plumbers who understand rural and small-town plumbing realities.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Uniondale plumbers serve both town residents and the surrounding farming community. Services include borehole pump installation and maintenance, water storage systems for farms, solar geyser installations (abundant Karoo sunshine makes them effective), and agricultural water systems for livestock and irrigation. Town-based services cover standard geyser repairs, drain unblocking, leak detection, and bathroom renovations. For the agricultural sector, plumbers handle dam and reservoir connections, stock watering systems, and pack-house plumbing for the fruit farms in the Long Kloof. The remote context means plumbers often need to solve problems with whatever resources are available.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Uniondale's remoteness creates a practical argument for professional plumbing. When the nearest plumbing supplier is an hour away, DIY mistakes become expensive in both time and frustration. Borehole systems — which most properties rely on — involve pumps, controls, and pressure systems requiring specialist knowledge. The extreme temperatures stress plumbing in ways that demand proper installation. While farming communities tend toward self-reliance, significant plumbing work is best left to professionals who can get it right the first time.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you request quotes through ProHub, plumbers serving Uniondale receive your job details. Most plumbers work from George or Oudtshoorn (45-60 minutes away), though some specialize in the Langkloof region. Emergency response times reflect these distances — expect 60-90 minutes for urgent callouts. Standard quotes typically arrive within a day. Plumbers experienced with this area understand farm logistics and often schedule multiple jobs per trip. For farm work, detailed site visits before quoting are standard.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Uniondale requires plumbers comfortable with remote, rural work. When reviewing ProHub quotes, ask about experience with farm plumbing, borehole systems, and willingness to travel to outlying properties. Reviews from other Langkloof or Karoo properties indicate relevant experience. Check that plumbers carry adequate parts inventory — return trips for fittings add significant time and cost. PIRB registration confirms professional standards, but rural problem-solving skills matter equally here.",
