  "guideIntro": "Nature's Valley is the Garden Route's most remote coastal village, a tiny community of around 500 properties nestled between the Tsitsikamma forest and the Indian Ocean. This isolation creates unique plumbing realities: there's no municipal sewage system (all properties use septic tanks), water supply depends on local sources, and the nearest major town is 30km away over the Groot River Pass. The pristine environment is protected — Nature's Valley sits within the Garden Route National Park — meaning plumbing work must meet strict environmental standards. Properties here range from original fisherman's cottages to modern eco-homes, all sharing the challenge of sustainable plumbing in a conservation area. ProHub connects Nature's Valley residents with plumbers who understand remote, off-grid requirements.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Nature's Valley plumbers specialise in sustainable, off-grid systems. Key services include septic tank installation, pumping, and maintenance (essential for every property), rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling, eco-friendly fixture installations, and low-water-use system design. Standard services cover geyser repairs (solar systems suit the sunny environment), leak detection, and bathroom renovations compliant with conservation area requirements. Given the remoteness, plumbers serving Nature's Valley often carry more parts than usual — a return trip for a fitting wastes half a day. Emergency services require planning for travel times.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Nature's Valley's environmental sensitivity makes professional plumbing non-negotiable for many jobs. Septic systems require proper design and installation to avoid contaminating the protected wetlands and lagoon. Any work near waterways needs environmental compliance. The remoteness also matters — a DIY mistake that requires parts or expertise from Plettenberg Bay or Knysna means days of waiting. For routine maintenance like tap washers, DIY is fine, but for anything involving drainage, septic systems, or significant repairs, use qualified professionals who understand the area's requirements.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you request quotes through ProHub, plumbers serving Nature's Valley (typically based in Plettenberg Bay, The Crags, or Storms River) receive your job details. Expect longer response times than urban areas — the access road via The Crags takes 20-30 minutes from Plett. Emergency responses are available but factor in travel time. For planned work, plumbers often batch multiple jobs to justify the trip. Quotes should reflect travel time and the need to bring comprehensive parts supplies.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Nature's Valley requires plumbers experienced in remote and off-grid properties. When reviewing ProHub quotes, ask specifically about septic system experience, familiarity with the village, and understanding of environmental requirements. Reviews from other Nature's Valley or Tsitsikamma properties indicate relevant experience. Check that plumbers carry necessary parts for common issues — you don't want to wait days for a fitting. For ongoing needs, find plumbers willing to establish a relationship with your property.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How much does a plumber cost in Nature's Valley?",
      "answer": "Nature's Valley plumber rates typically range from R450-R700 per hour, plus significant travel charges (R300-R600 depending on origin). The remoteness justifies premium pricing. Common job prices: geyser service R1,200-R2,500, septic pump-out R2,500-R5,000, tap replacement R500-R1,000 including travel. Get multiple ProHub quotes to compare."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do septic systems work in Nature's Valley?",
      "answer": "All Nature's Valley properties use septic tank systems since there's no municipal sewage. Waste flows to a tank where solids settle and decompose; liquid drains to a soakaway or French drain. Systems need pumping every 2-5 years depending on usage. Proper maintenance is essential — failing septic systems can contaminate the protected lagoon and wetlands, resulting in significant environmental penalties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there environmental restrictions on plumbing work?",
      "answer": "Yes, Nature's Valley is within the Garden Route National Park, with strict environmental controls. Drainage must not affect wetlands or the lagoon. Greywater systems require specific standards. Any excavation may need permits. Local plumbers understand these requirements and ensure compliance. Unauthorised work that damages the environment can result in substantial fines."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take plumbers to reach Nature's Valley?",
      "answer": "Most plumbers serving Nature's Valley are based in Plettenberg Bay (25-30 minutes away) or Storms River (20 minutes). Emergency response typically takes 45-90 minutes including mobilisation. For planned work, plumbers often schedule specific days for the area to batch multiple jobs. Confirm expected arrival times when booking."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do plumbers service The Crags and Kurland areas?",
      "answer": "Yes, ProHub plumbers serving Nature's Valley typically also cover The Crags, Kurland, and surrounding areas along the N2. These areas share similar characteristics — mix of municipal and septic systems, rural properties, varying access conditions. Confirm coverage when requesting quotes."
