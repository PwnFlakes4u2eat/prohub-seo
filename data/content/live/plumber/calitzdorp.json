  "guideIntro": "Calitzdorp is South Africa's port wine capital, a small Klein Karoo town where historic Cape Dutch architecture and working wine cellars line the streets. This heritage brings character but also plumbing challenges — many buildings date back a century or more, with pipe systems that have been patched and modified over generations. The semi-arid climate means water is precious and expensive, with most properties supplementing municipal supply with borehole or rainwater storage. Summer temperatures regularly exceed 40°C while winter nights frost over, creating thermal stress that tests any plumbing system. ProHub connects Calitzdorp residents with verified plumbers who understand both historic building requirements and Klein Karoo conditions.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Calitzdorp plumbers handle the town's unique mix of heritage and practical requirements. Services include sensitive repairs to historic buildings that preserve character while improving function, borehole pump and storage tank systems, solar geyser installations (ideal for the region's abundant sunshine), and pipe insulation for freeze protection. For the wine cellars and cellars converted to hospitality venues, commercial plumbing maintaining historic aesthetics is a specialty. Standard services cover leak detection (crucial when water is scarce), drain unblocking, geyser repairs, and bathroom renovations that respect heritage building guidelines.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Calitzdorp's historic buildings and extreme climate make professional expertise essential. Heritage properties often have complex, multi-generational plumbing systems where disturbing one section reveals problems throughout. The thermal cycling between hot days and cold nights stresses joints and seals in ways that generic repairs don't address. Borehole systems involve pumps and controls requiring specialist knowledge. For anything beyond basic maintenance, plumbers familiar with both historic buildings and Klein Karoo conditions deliver better results.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you request quotes through ProHub, plumbers serving Calitzdorp receive your job details. The small town means most plumbers travel from Oudtshoorn or other nearby centres, so factor in travel time for quotes and scheduling. Emergency response is available but may take 30-60 minutes depending on origin. For heritage properties, expect plumbers to assess building age and condition before quoting. Standard quotes typically arrive within a day. For wine cellars and commercial properties, site visits before final quotes are standard.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Calitzdorp's heritage character requires plumbers who respect old buildings. When reviewing ProHub quotes, ask about experience with historic properties, understanding of heritage guidelines, and familiarity with Klein Karoo climate challenges. Reviews from other Route 62 or Klein Karoo properties indicate relevant experience. For wine cellars and hospitality venues, check commercial experience and references. PIRB registration confirms professional standards.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does extreme temperature affect plumbing in Calitzdorp?",

Local plumbers install expansion-compensating fittings, proper insulation, and recommend materials suited to wide temperature ranges."
    },
    {
