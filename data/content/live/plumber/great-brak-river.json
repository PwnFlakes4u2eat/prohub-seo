  "guideIntro": "Great Brak River — Grootbrak to locals — sits at the mouth of the river that gives it its name, creating unique plumbing challenges rarely found elsewhere on the Garden Route. Properties along the riverbank and lagoon experience tidal influences on their drainage and water tables, while the estuary's brackish water accelerates corrosion in ways pure saltwater doesn't. From the established village with its historic character to the newer developments on the island and along the river, properties need plumbers who understand how living water shapes plumbing systems. The town's quiet character belies technical complexity. ProHub connects Great Brak River residents with verified plumbers experienced in tidal properties and estuary-side challenges.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Great Brak River plumbers specialise in the unique challenges of estuary living. Services include drainage systems designed for tidal water table fluctuations, backflow prevention critical for properties where water levels change daily, corrosion-resistant installations for brackish water exposure, and sump pump systems for low-lying properties. Standard services cover geyser repairs and installations, leak detection, bathroom renovations, and drain unblocking. For the island properties and homes directly on the river, plumbers need experience with below-sea-level drainage and tidal influences that reverse flow directions.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Great Brak River's tidal environment makes plumbing more complex than it appears. Drainage that works at low tide can fail spectacularly when the water table rises, and brackish water creates corrosion patterns different from either freshwater or pure salt exposure. Properties on the island and directly along the river require specialist knowledge about tidal drainage — a DIY installation that ignores these factors will cause problems during spring tides. For anything beyond basic tap maintenance, use plumbers who know the river and its influence.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Submit your request through ProHub and up to 5 verified plumbers serving Great Brak River will receive your job details. Most plumbers come from the Mossel Bay or George area, with some local specialists. Emergency response is generally quick given the N2 accessibility. For properties on the river or island, expect plumbers to assess tidal conditions — some work needs to be scheduled around low tide. Detailed quotes should address the specific challenges of your property's location relative to the water.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Great Brak River demands plumbers with specific local experience. When reviewing ProHub quotes, ask about familiarity with tidal properties, backflow systems, and estuary corrosion. Reviews from other riverfront or island property owners indicate relevant experience. For drainage work, confirm understanding of how the twice-daily tidal cycle affects your property's plumbing. PIRB registration ensures professional standards, but local knowledge is equally valuable here.",

    {
      "question": "How does the tidal river affect plumbing in Great Brak?",
      "answer": "The Great Brak estuary creates twice-daily tidal cycles that affect water tables and drainage throughout low-lying areas. Properties near the river may experience reversed flow during high tides, requiring backflow prevention. Drainage efficiency varies with tidal conditions. Local plumbers design systems that function across the full tidal range."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is brackish water corrosion?",
      "answer": "Great Brak River's estuary mixes saltwater and freshwater, creating brackish conditions. This mix is actually more corrosive than pure salt or fresh water due to electrochemical effects. Properties using river water or affected by groundwater seepage experience accelerated pipe and fitting corrosion. Local plumbers recommend specific materials and more frequent inspections for affected properties."
