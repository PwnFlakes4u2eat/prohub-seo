  "guideIntro": "Mossel Bay combines industrial strength with coastal charm, and its plumbing needs reflect that diversity. From the historic buildings around The Point and Munro's Bay to the family suburbs of Dana Bay and Pinnacle Point, properties range from century-old harbour cottages to modern golf estates. The town's position as an industrial hub — with PetroSA and various manufacturing facilities — means commercial plumbing expertise is readily available alongside residential services. Coastal winds drive salt corrosion, while the older town centre's ageing infrastructure creates its own challenges. Whether you're maintaining a holiday flat in Hartenbos, running a guesthouse on the beachfront, or managing an industrial facility, having reliable local plumbers on call is essential. ProHub connects Mossel Bay residents with verified professionals who understand both the coast and the town's diverse property types.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Mossel Bay plumbers handle everything from emergency burst pipes to industrial installations. Residential services include geyser repairs and solar conversions (popular in the sunny climate), drain unblocking, leak detection, and bathroom renovations. The town's industrial presence means many plumbers also offer commercial services — factory plumbing, grease trap installations for the harbour-area restaurants, and large-scale water systems. Coastal corrosion expertise is essential, with plumbers replacing salt-damaged pipes and installing marine-grade fittings. Water tank installations are increasingly common as residents seek backup supplies during municipal outages.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Mossel Bay's combination of salt air, ageing infrastructure in the town centre, and water pressure variations makes professional expertise critical. What looks like a simple leak might indicate salt corrosion throughout your system. The older properties around The Point often have plumbing that's been patched over decades — disturbing one section can reveal problems elsewhere. For anything beyond basic tap washer changes, qualified plumbers with local knowledge are worth the investment. Geyser work is particularly risky in coastal environments where corrosion weakens pressure valves.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Submit your request through ProHub and up to 5 verified Mossel Bay plumbers will receive your job details. For emergencies like burst pipes or geyser failures, expect rapid responses — most offer 24/7 callouts across the municipal area. Standard quotes typically arrive within hours. Mossel Bay plumbers should factor in property specifics: older Point-area homes may need careful assessment, while Dana Bay and Pinnacle Point properties often have more modern systems. For industrial work, expect detailed site visits and comprehensive quotes.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look for plumbers with experience across Mossel Bay's diverse property types. ProHub reviews will show whether they handle both residential and light commercial work, and how they perform in coastal conditions. PIRB or IOPSA registration is important, but so is familiarity with the local area — a plumber who's worked the Santos Beach apartments and the industrial zone understands different challenges. For geyser installations, confirm SABS compliance and CoC provision. Check emergency response times, especially for holiday properties that may sit empty.",
