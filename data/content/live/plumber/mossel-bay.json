  "heroSubtitle": "Connect with Mossel Bay's top-rated plumbers in minutes. Whether you need emergency leak repairs at the Point, a geyser upgrade in Hartenbos, or a full bathroom renovation in Dana Bay — get up to 5 free quotes from verified local professionals.",
  "guideServiceTypes": "Mossel Bay plumbers offer comprehensive services from emergency repairs to major installations. Common jobs include burst pipe repairs, geyser replacements (electric, solar, and heat pump), blocked drain clearing, leak detection, and bathroom renovations. Given Mossel Bay's coastal location, many plumbers specialise in corrosion-resistant fittings and marine-grade materials. The area's mix of older heritage properties in the CBD and modern homes in estates like Pinnacle Point means local plumbers are experienced with both period plumbing systems and contemporary installations.",
  "guideDiyVsPro": "Basic tasks like replacing tap washers, using a plunger on minor blockages, or adjusting geyser temperatures are generally safe DIY jobs. However, Mossel Bay's municipal bylaws require licensed plumbers for any work on water mains, geyser installations, or sewerage connections. The town's high water table — especially in low-lying areas near the harbour — means even small leaks can quickly become serious. For anything beyond simple maintenance, calling a qualified plumber protects your property and ensures compliance.",
  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you hire a plumber through ProHub in Mossel Bay, expect a professional who knows the local area. They'll arrive with the right tools, assess your problem, and provide a clear quote before starting work. Most standard repairs — like fixing leaks or unblocking drains — can be completed in a single visit. For larger jobs like bathroom renovations or geyser installations, your plumber will provide a detailed timeline and keep you updated throughout. Mossel Bay plumbers understand the unique challenges of coastal properties and holiday homes that may sit vacant for periods.",
  "guideChoosingProvider": "When selecting a plumber in Mossel Bay, prioritise local experience — they'll understand the specific challenges of coastal plumbing, from salt air corrosion to the area's water pressure variations. Check ProHub reviews from other Mossel Bay residents and verify PIRB registration for compliance work. For geyser installations, confirm they provide Certificates of Compliance. Ask about emergency availability, especially if you own a holiday property and need someone who can respond when you're not there.",
