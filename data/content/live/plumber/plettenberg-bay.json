  "guideIntro": "Plettenberg Bay is the Garden Route's upmarket playground, where luxury holiday homes, boutique hotels, and exclusive estates demand plumbing services to match. From the clifftop properties of Robberg and Signal Hill to the beachfront residences at Beacon Isle and Lookout Beach, Plett's real estate commands premium prices — and property owners expect premium service. The challenge is that many properties sit empty for months between holiday visits, then need instant hot water, perfect pressure, and flawless bathrooms when owners arrive. Salt air corrodes coastal fittings, summer storms test drainage systems, and the town's water infrastructure strains during peak December-January periods. ProHub connects Plett residents and property managers with verified plumbers who understand the high-end market and can deliver quality that matches the town's reputation.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Plettenberg Bay plumbers cater to upmarket properties with services ranging from emergency callouts to complete luxury bathroom installations. Core services include geyser repairs and heat pump installations (energy efficiency matters for large holiday homes), leak detection in complex multi-bathroom properties, drain maintenance for pools and outdoor showers, and high-end fixture installations. Many Plett plumbers specialise in holiday home management — annual inspections, pre-arrival checks, and rapid response when something fails during a family's Christmas visit. Commercial services support the town's hospitality sector, from boutique hotels to busy restaurants along the Main Street strip.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "In Plettenberg Bay's high-value property market, the stakes for DIY plumbing gone wrong are significant. A water leak in a R15 million Robberg home isn't just an inconvenience — it's potential catastrophic damage to designer finishes and underfloor heating systems. The salt air environment means corrosion is always a factor, and Plett's complex properties often have plumbing systems that require specialist knowledge. For anything beyond the most basic maintenance, use qualified professionals. The cost of a plumber is trivial compared to the cost of water damage in a luxury property.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you request quotes through ProHub, up to 5 verified Plettenberg Bay plumbers receive your job details. For emergencies, expect rapid response — property managers and holiday homeowners can't wait when guests are arriving. Standard quotes typically come within hours, and for Plett's premium properties, plumbers often offer same-day site visits. Quality plumbers here understand discretion (some properties have famous owners), flexible scheduling around guest visits, and the importance of leaving properties immaculate after work.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Plettenberg Bay's property market demands plumbers who understand upmarket expectations. When reviewing ProHub quotes, look for experience with luxury properties, high-end fixture brands (Hansgrohe, Kohler, Duravit), and holiday home management. Reviews should mention professionalism, punctuality, and cleanliness — essential when working in designer homes. PIRB registration matters, but so does a track record with complex properties. For property managers, find plumbers willing to hold keys and respond to after-hours emergencies.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Do Plettenberg Bay plumbers offer emergency services?",
      "answer": "Yes, most Plett plumbers offer 24/7 emergency callouts — essential for holiday homes where problems often emerge when owners arrive. Emergency rates are typically 1.5-2x standard rates. During peak season (December-January), response times may be longer due to demand. Mark requests as urgent on ProHub and specify if guests are waiting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can plumbers manage holiday home plumbing in Plett?",
      "answer": "Yes, many Plettenberg Bay plumbers offer property management services including annual inspections, geyser checks before holiday visits, and rapid-response contracts for emergencies. This is particularly valuable for out-of-town owners whose properties sit empty for months. Ask about maintenance contracts when requesting ProHub quotes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is water pressure variable in Plettenberg Bay?",
      "answer": "Plett's water pressure fluctuates seasonally — the town's population can triple during peak holiday periods, straining municipal infrastructure. Properties on higher ground (Signal Hill, Robberg) experience lower pressure during peak times. Local plumbers often install pressure pumps and storage tanks to ensure consistent supply. Summer water restrictions add another layer of complexity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which areas do Plettenberg Bay plumbers service?",
      "answer": "ProHub plumbers cover all Plett areas including Central, Beacon Isle, Robberg, Signal Hill, Lookout Beach, The Crags, Keurbooms, and Nature's Valley. Many also service Knysna, Storms River, and surrounding areas. Confirm coverage and any travel fees for outlying properties when requesting quotes."
