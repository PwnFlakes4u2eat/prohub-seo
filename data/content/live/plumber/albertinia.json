  "guideIntro": "Albertinia is South Africa's aloe capital, a small N2 town where the aloe processing industry shapes the local economy. The town sits between the coastal strip and the interior, giving it a climate that transitions between the Garden Route's humidity and the Karoo's dryness. Properties range from the modest homes of the town centre to the farms producing aloe, cattle, and grain in the surrounding area. Water infrastructure reflects this agricultural focus — boreholes supplement municipal supply, and farms need plumbing that supports both domestic and processing requirements. ProHub connects Albertinia residents and farmers with verified plumbers who understand the town's mix of residential and light-industrial needs.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Albertinia plumbers handle both residential and agricultural requirements. Services include geyser repairs and installations, drain unblocking, leak detection, and bathroom renovations for town properties. For the aloe processing industry and farms, plumbers provide industrial-scale water systems, processing facility plumbing, and agricultural water management. Borehole pump maintenance serves farms supplementing municipal supply. The transitional climate means some properties face Karoo-like challenges (hard water, temperature extremes) while others deal with more coastal conditions — experienced plumbers adapt their approach accordingly.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Albertinia's size means plumbing services are available but not abundant. A DIY mistake that requires professional correction may mean waiting for a plumber to travel from Riversdale or Mossel Bay. For the agricultural sector, food-processing compliance adds another layer of complexity that professionals handle better. The transitional climate creates mixed challenges that benefit from experienced assessment. For basic maintenance DIY is fine, but significant repairs or installations benefit from professional handling.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you request quotes through ProHub, plumbers serving Albertinia receive your job details. Some plumbers are based locally, while others travel from Riversdale, Mossel Bay, or George. Emergency response is generally available same-day. Standard quotes typically arrive within hours. For farm and industrial work, expect site visits before final quotes. Plumbers familiar with the area understand both the aloe industry requirements and standard residential needs.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Albertinia benefits from plumbers who understand its mixed residential and agricultural character. When reviewing ProHub quotes, ask about experience with the property type you have — whether standard residential, farming, or aloe processing. Reviews from other N2 corridor or agricultural properties indicate relevant experience. For processing facilities, check food-industry compliance knowledge. PIRB registration confirms professional residential standards.",
