  "guideIntro": "Ladismith lies in the Klein Karoo beneath the dramatic Towerkop peak, an agricultural town where farming and cheese production drive the economy. The town's water infrastructure reflects its farming heritage — extensive irrigation systems, multiple boreholes serving farms and the town, and the constant challenge of managing water in a semi-arid region. Properties range from historic village homes to working farms with complex plumbing needs spanning domestic, agricultural, and dairy requirements. The extreme Karoo climate — scorching summers and frosty winters — adds another layer of complexity. ProHub connects Ladismith residents and farmers with verified plumbers who understand both household and agricultural plumbing requirements.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Ladismith plumbers serve both residential and agricultural needs. Services include borehole pump installation and maintenance, irrigation system plumbing for farms, water storage and reservoir systems, and dairy-compliant plumbing for the town's cheese industry. Residential services cover geyser repairs and solar installations, drain unblocking, leak detection, and bathroom renovations. For the agricultural sector, plumbers handle livestock water systems, wash-down facilities, and the specific requirements of food production environments. Given the climate extremes, frost protection and thermal expansion management are standard considerations.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Ladismith's agricultural context means plumbing often involves systems more complex than typical residential work. Borehole pumps, pressure systems, and irrigation networks require specialist knowledge — mistakes can damage expensive equipment or waste precious water. Even residential plumbing in the Klein Karoo faces extreme conditions that demand proper materials and installation. For farms, compliance with health regulations for dairy and food production adds another reason to use qualified professionals. Basic maintenance is fine, but leave significant work to plumbers who know agricultural systems.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Submit your request through ProHub and plumbers serving Ladismith receive your job details. The town has local plumbers, with additional coverage from Oudtshoorn and Barrydale. Emergency response is available, though response times vary based on plumber location — typically 30-60 minutes from the nearest centre. For farm work, plumbers often schedule site visits to understand the full scope of irrigation and water systems. Standard residential quotes usually arrive within hours. Agricultural quotes may take longer due to system complexity.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Ladismith needs plumbers comfortable with both household and agricultural work. When reviewing ProHub quotes, ask about experience with borehole systems, irrigation plumbing, and if relevant, food-production compliance. Reviews from other Klein Karoo properties indicate relevant experience. For farms, verify understanding of agricultural water systems and livestock requirements. PIRB registration confirms residential competence, while agricultural experience is assessed separately through references and reviews.",
