  "guideIntro": "Knysna's unique lagoon setting creates plumbing challenges unlike anywhere else on the Garden Route. From the waterfront properties of Leisure Isle and Thesen Islands to the hillside homes of Paradise and The Heads, salt air corrosion and tidal water table fluctuations demand specialist knowledge. The town's status as a premier tourism destination means holiday homes sit empty for months then need instant hot water when owners arrive, while guesthouses and restaurants along Waterfront Drive need commercial-grade systems that handle seasonal surges. Add the legacy of older plumbing in central Knysna and the ever-present risk of pipe damage from the area's sandy, shifting soils, and you'll understand why having a reliable local plumber is essential. ProHub connects Knysna residents with verified plumbing professionals who know the lagoon area intimately.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Knysna plumbers specialise in coastal corrosion issues — replacing copper pipes eaten by salt air, installing marine-grade fittings for waterfront properties, and fitting sacrificial anodes to protect geyser systems. Standard services include emergency burst pipe repairs, geyser installations (solar systems are popular given the town's eco-conscious community), drain unblocking for holiday lets between guests, and full bathroom renovations. Many Knysna plumbers also handle boat and houseboat plumbing for the lagoon's floating community, grease trap maintenance for the town's many restaurants, and water tank installations for properties not on municipal supply in areas like Brenton-on-Sea and Rheenendal.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Knysna's coastal environment makes professional expertise even more critical than inland areas. That corroded fitting might look like a simple replacement, but salt damage often extends further than visible — what starts as a tap repair can reveal compromised pipes throughout. Geyser work in high-humidity environments requires proper ventilation and marine-grade components. For Leisure Isle and Thesen Islands properties, any plumbing modifications need to account for tidal influences and the unique drainage challenges of reclaimed land. Leave it to plumbers who understand these conditions.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Request quotes through ProHub and up to 5 verified Knysna plumbers receive your job details. Emergency calls for burst pipes or geyser failures typically get responses within minutes — essential when water damage threatens holiday bookings or lagoon-side properties. Standard quotes arrive within hours. Knysna plumbers familiar with the area will factor in access challenges for island properties (some require boat access) and the specific needs of holiday homes. For larger renovations, expect site visits that assess salt exposure and existing pipe conditions.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Knysna's plumbing environment demands experience with coastal conditions. When reviewing ProHub quotes, ask specifically about experience with salt corrosion, marine-grade fittings, and lagoon-area properties. Check reviews for comments about work quality in humid environments. PIRB or IOPSA registration matters, but so does local knowledge — a plumber who's worked The Heads and Leisure Isle understands challenges that inland plumbers don't. For geyser work, confirm SABS compliance and that they provide a proper CoC.",

    {
      "question": "How much does a plumber cost in Knysna?",
      "answer": "Knysna plumber rates typically range from R450-R700 per hour, reflecting the specialist coastal expertise required. Callout fees average R400-R600, with premium rates for Leisure Isle, Thesen Islands, and after-hours emergencies.

    },
    {
      "question": "Do Knysna plumbers offer emergency services?",
      "answer": "Yes, most Knysna plumbers offer 24/7 emergency callouts — critical for a tourism town where burst pipes can ruin guest bookings. Emergency rates are typically 1.5-2x standard rates. Island properties and The Heads may have additional access fees. Mark urgent requests on ProHub for fastest response from available plumbers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do pipes corrode faster in Knysna?",
      "answer": "Knysna's lagoon location means constant salt air exposure, accelerating corrosion in copper and galvanised pipes. Waterfront properties suffer worst, but even hillside homes in Paradise and Hunters Home experience faster pipe degradation than inland areas. Local plumbers recommend marine-grade fittings, regular inspections, and in some cases, switching to plastic piping where appropriate."
