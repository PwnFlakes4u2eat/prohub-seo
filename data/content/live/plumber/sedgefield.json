  "guideIntro": "Sedgefield is South Africa's official Slow Town, and its relaxed pace extends to everything except plumbing emergencies. This charming lagoon-side village between Wilderness and Knysna attracts retirees and holiday homeowners seeking a quieter life, but the area's water challenges are anything but peaceful. The Swartvlei lagoon influence means high water tables and salinity issues, while the village's popularity for retirement means many properties need accessibility modifications to bathrooms. From the Cola Beach area to the golf estate and the quirky homes around the Wild Oats market, Sedgefield's eclectic property mix needs plumbers who appreciate both the lifestyle and the technical challenges. ProHub connects Sedgefield residents with verified plumbers who work at the right pace — thorough and careful, but responsive when needed.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Sedgefield plumbers cater to the village's mix of retirees, holiday homeowners, and permanent residents. Standard services include geyser repairs and energy-efficient upgrades (important on fixed retirement incomes), drain unblocking and maintenance for properties on sandy soil, and bathroom renovations with accessibility features like grab rails and walk-in showers. The lagoon environment means expertise in corrosion-resistant installations and drainage systems that handle high water tables. For the many holiday homes, seasonal maintenance and pre-arrival checks are valuable. Rainwater harvesting systems are popular among the environmentally-conscious community.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Sedgefield's easy-going atmosphere shouldn't extend to DIY plumbing experiments. The village's sandy soil and high water table mean drainage problems can quickly become serious, and the lagoon's influence on groundwater creates corrosion issues that aren't immediately visible. For older residents, attempting plumbing repairs can be physically risky — wet bathroom floors and awkward positions under sinks cause falls. The cost of a professional plumber is worthwhile for safety, quality, and the peace of mind that comes with knowing the job is done right.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "Submit your request through ProHub and up to 5 verified plumbers serving Sedgefield will receive your job details. Response times reflect the town's location — plumbers may come from Sedgefield itself, Knysna, or George. For emergencies, most offer same-day callouts. Standard quotes arrive within hours. Good Sedgefield plumbers understand the community — they're patient with elderly residents, explain work clearly, and respect the slow-town pace while still being efficient. For holiday homes, expect understanding of the urgency when owners arrive to find issues.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Sedgefield's demographic means plumber reviews often mention patience, clear communication, and trustworthiness — important when working with elderly clients. Check ProHub reviews for these qualities alongside technical competence. Experience with the lagoon area's specific challenges (corrosion, drainage, high water tables) is valuable. For ongoing maintenance, find plumbers who offer regular check-up services and can build a relationship with your property. PIRB registration confirms professional standards.",
