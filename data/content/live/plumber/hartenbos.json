  "guideIntro": "Hartenbos is the Garden Route's quintessential family beach resort, where holiday flats, caravan parks, and family homes fill to capacity every December. This creates a unique plumbing challenge: properties designed for two people suddenly host extended families, stressing geysers, drains, and water pressure to their limits during peak season. The rest of the year, many flats and holiday homes sit empty, allowing small problems to become major ones unnoticed. Located just east of Mossel Bay, Hartenbos faces similar coastal corrosion challenges, while its concentration of older resort-style accommodation means ageing plumbing infrastructure is common. ProHub connects Hartenbos property owners with verified plumbers who understand the resort town rhythm — rapid response during busy seasons, and preventive maintenance when things quiet down.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Hartenbos plumbers handle both residential needs and the unique demands of holiday accommodation. Services include geyser repairs and upgrades (larger units for holiday homes that host multiple families), drain unblocking (essential after peak season usage), leak detection in properties that have sat empty, and bathroom renovations to modernise older resort accommodation. Commercial services support the area's guesthouses, holiday resorts, and caravan parks. Pre-season inspections are valuable — checking that everything works before the December rush arrives. Water-saving fixtures help manage costs for properties with high seasonal usage.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hartenbos's seasonal usage patterns make professional plumbing particularly important. Small leaks that develop while properties sit empty can cause significant water damage over months. Holiday accommodation must comply with health and safety standards — DIY plumbing that doesn't meet code can jeopardise your rental licence. During peak season, there's simply no time for DIY experiments — when a geyser fails on Christmas Eve with a house full of guests, you need a professional who can fix it fast. Invest in proper maintenance to avoid holiday disasters.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you request quotes through ProHub, up to 5 verified plumbers serving Hartenbos receive your job details. During peak season (December-January), response times may be longer due to high demand — book non-emergency work for shoulder seasons when possible. Standard quotes arrive within hours. Hartenbos plumbers understand the urgency when holiday accommodation is involved — lost bookings mean lost income. For property managers handling multiple units, find plumbers who offer maintenance contracts and priority response agreements.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Hartenbos needs plumbers who understand holiday accommodation. When reviewing ProHub quotes, look for experience with multiple-unit properties, familiarity with guesthouse requirements, and flexibility around guest schedules. Reviews should mention reliability during peak season and quality of emergency response. For rental properties, confirm plumbers can provide documentation needed for compliance. Check availability for pre-season inspections — a good plumber will help you avoid December emergencies.",
