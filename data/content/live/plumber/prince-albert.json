  "guideIntro": "Prince Albert is one of South Africa's most perfectly preserved Karoo villages, where historic Cape Dutch and Victorian buildings line streets shaded by ancient trees. The town's remarkable water system — fed by mountain springs through centuries-old furrows — creates both charm and plumbing complexity. Many properties still connect to this heritage water network alongside modern municipal supply, requiring plumbers who understand both. The town's popularity with artists, writers, and weekenders from Cape Town means historic homes converted to modern living, guest houses needing commercial-grade systems, and cottages requiring sensitive upgrades. ProHub connects Prince Albert residents with verified plumbers who respect heritage while delivering modern reliability.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "Prince Albert plumbers specialise in heritage property plumbing. Services include sensitive repairs that preserve historic character, connecting properties to the water furrow system, upgrading plumbing in listed buildings within conservation guidelines, and installing modern conveniences without disrupting period aesthetics. For the town's many guest houses, commercial hot water systems and multi-bathroom installations are routine. Standard services cover geyser repairs, drain unblocking, and leak detection — critical when water damage threatens irreplaceable historic fabric. Solar geyser installations are popular, positioned to avoid visual impact on heritage streetscapes.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Prince Albert's heritage status makes professional plumbing essential for most work. The historic buildings have complex, often unique plumbing arrangements developed over a century or more. The water furrow system requires specific knowledge to maintain and connect to. Improper work can damage irreplaceable historic fabric and may violate heritage regulations. For anything beyond basic tap maintenance, use plumbers experienced in conservation-area work. The cost is justified by protecting properties that represent both significant investment and community heritage.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you request quotes through ProHub, plumbers serving Prince Albert receive your job details. The town's remoteness (over the Swartberg Pass from Oudtshoorn, or via the Karoo from Graaff-Reinet) means most plumbers travel from nearby centres. Emergency response may take 45-90 minutes. Standard quotes typically arrive within a day. Good Prince Albert plumbers will ask about property age, heritage status, and the nature of water supply (municipal, furrow, borehole) before quoting. Site visits are often needed for historic properties.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Prince Albert demands plumbers who respect heritage buildings. When reviewing ProHub quotes, ask specifically about experience with historic properties, understanding of conservation guidelines, and familiarity with the water furrow system. Reviews from other heritage or Karoo properties indicate relevant experience. Check approach to visible plumbing in period interiors — a good plumber will discuss aesthetics alongside function. PIRB registration confirms professional standards.",
