  "guideIntro": "George's unique location at the foot of the Outeniqua Mountains, combined with its mild, humid climate, creates ideal conditions for a wide range of pests. From the older suburbs of Denneoord and Pacaltsdorp where ageing structures attract rodents and wood borers, to the coastal dampness near Herolds Bay that brings cockroaches indoors, pest problems in George require local expertise. The town's mix of residential estates, commercial centres along York Street, and surrounding farmland means pest controllers here deal with everything from restaurant infestations to compliance certificates for property sales. ProHub connects George residents and businesses with verified pest control professionals who understand the region's seasonal pest patterns and can respond quickly to both emergency callouts and scheduled treatments.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "George pest control companies offer comprehensive services tailored to the Garden Route's pest challenges. Common treatments include rodent control using tamper-proof bait stations, traps, and exclusion methods for rats and mice; insect control covering cockroaches, ants, fleas, bedbugs, and general household pests; wood borer inspections and fumigation with compliance certificates required for property transfers; termite inspections and soil treatments for pre-construction and existing buildings; bird and rodent proofing including spike installations, mesh barriers, and entry point sealing; and bee and wasp nest removal with honeybee relocation options where possible. Many George pest controllers also provide HACCP-compliant programmes for restaurants and food businesses.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Hardware store sprays might knock down a few visible insects, but they won't solve an infestation. Pests like German cockroaches breed rapidly in hidden areas — behind fridges, inside wall cavities, under sinks — where surface sprays don't reach. DIY rodent control often fails because rats are neophobic (fear new objects) and will avoid poorly placed traps for weeks. Wood borer and termite treatments require specialised detection equipment and registered pesticides that aren't available to consumers. For bee or wasp nests, attempting removal without proper protection risks serious stings and, for those with allergies, life-threatening reactions. Professional pest controllers use commercial-grade products, know exactly where pests hide, and provide certificates and guarantees on their work.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you submit a pest control request through ProHub, up to 5 verified George pest controllers receive your details. Most respond within hours — faster for urgent infestations. Expect questions about the type of pest, severity of the problem, and property size. For wood borer certificates and termite inspections, companies will need to conduct a physical inspection before providing final pricing. Quotes should include the treatment method, products used, safety information (especially important if you have children or pets), any certificates provided, and follow-up visits included. For ongoing pest management, many George companies offer monthly or quarterly service contracts at reduced rates.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Look beyond price when selecting a pest controller. Check that they're registered with the Department of Agriculture and hold valid pesticide applicator certifications. Read ProHub reviews for comments about effectiveness — did the pests actually stay gone? — and professionalism. Ask about their guarantee policy: reputable companies offer free follow-up treatments if pests return within a specified period. For wood borer certificates, ensure they're qualified to issue certificates recognised by conveyancing attorneys. Companies that take time to explain the treatment process and provide aftercare instructions typically deliver better results than those offering suspiciously cheap quotes.",

    {
      "question": "What pests are common in George?",
      "answer": "George's humid Garden Route climate supports diverse pest populations. Most common are German and American cockroaches (especially near the coast), rats and mice (prevalent in older suburbs and near restaurants), and wood borers in roof timbers and furniture. Seasonal pests include wasps from spring through autumn and increased rodent activity in winter. Pigeons are a growing problem in commercial areas, requiring bird proofing solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wood borer certificate when selling my house in George?",
      "answer": "Yes, most conveyancing attorneys in George require a wood borer and beetle-free certificate before property transfer. A qualified pest inspector examines roof timbers, wooden floors, door frames, and furniture for signs of active infestation or previous damage. If treatment is needed, the property is fumigated and a clearance certificate issued. Budget R1,500-R3,500 depending on property size and whether treatment is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I keep rodents out of my George property?",
      "answer": "Prevention is key for rodent control. Seal gaps around pipes, under doors, and in walls — mice can squeeze through 6mm gaps. Store food in sealed containers, keep bins closed, and remove pet food at night. Trim vegetation away from buildings and clear clutter that provides hiding spots. For active infestations, professional baiting programmes are more effective than DIY traps. Our George pest controllers can also install proofing measures to prevent re-entry."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do George pest controllers offer emergency callouts?",
      "answer": "Yes, many George pest control companies offer same-day or emergency services for urgent situations like wasp nest discoveries, snake sightings, or severe infestations. Weekend and after-hours callouts typically carry a premium of R200-R500. When submitting your ProHub request, mark it as urgent and describe the situation clearly to get faster responses from available providers."
