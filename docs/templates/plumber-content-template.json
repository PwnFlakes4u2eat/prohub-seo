  "guideIntro": "George sits at the heart of the Garden Route, where reliable plumbing is essential for everything from holiday homes to busy commercial centres. The region's mix of older properties in Denneoord and Pacaltsdorp alongside newer estates in Heatherlands means plumbing challenges vary widely — from replacing galvanised pipes in 1960s homes to installing water-saving systems in modern builds. Add to that George's water restrictions during dry spells and the occasional winter flooding, and having a trusted local plumber on call becomes a necessity rather than a luxury. ProHub connects George residents with verified plumbing professionals who understand the municipality's bylaws, know where the ageing infrastructure causes problems, and can respond quickly when things go wrong.",

  "guideServiceTypes": "George plumbers handle everything from emergency burst pipe repairs to complete bathroom renovations. Common services include geyser installations and repairs (electric and solar), drain unblocking using high-pressure jetting, leak detection using specialised equipment, toilet and tap repairs, and full repiping for older properties. Many George plumbers also offer water tank and pump installations — increasingly popular given municipal water concerns — as well as grease trap maintenance for restaurants along York Street and the Wilderness commercial strip. For property sales, plumbers provide condition reports that complement the required CoC.",

  "guideDiyVsPro": "Replacing a tap washer or unclogging a drain with a plunger? Go for it. But anything beyond basic maintenance should go to a qualified plumber. Burst pipes, geyser work, and any modifications to your plumbing system require professional expertise — and often municipal approval. In George, DIY plumbing that goes wrong can result in water damage to your property, flooding of neighbouring properties (especially in lower-lying areas like Blanco), and disputes with your insurance company. Geyser work is particularly risky: a poorly installed pressure valve or thermostat can cause explosions. The money you save isn't worth the risk.",

  "guideWhatToExpect": "When you request quotes through ProHub, up to 5 verified George plumbers receive your job details. For emergencies like burst pipes or overflowing geysers, expect calls within minutes — most George plumbers offer 24/7 emergency response. For standard jobs, you'll typically receive multiple quotes within a few hours. Quotes should itemise labour, parts, and any callout fees (some charge extra for Wilderness, Herolds Bay, or farm calls). For larger projects like bathroom renovations, plumbers will usually request a site visit before providing a final quote.",

  "guideChoosingProvider": "Price matters, but so does reliability. Check each plumber's ProHub reviews — look for comments about punctuality, cleanliness, and whether they honoured their quotes. Ask if they're a registered member of PIRB (Plumbing Industry Registration Board) or IOPSA (Institute of Plumbing SA). For geyser work, confirm they provide a CoC and that their work is SABS compliant. Check their response time for emergencies — in George, a burst pipe during a winter cold snap or a blocked drain on a Friday evening needs someone who'll actually answer the phone.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do I find a reliable plumber in George?",
      "answer": "ProHub verifies all listed plumbers with ID and business checks. Read reviews from other George customers, check response times, and confirm they're PIRB or IOPSA registered. Avoid anyone who won't provide a written quote or demands full payment upfront. Multiple quotes let you compare value, not just price."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is my water pressure low in George?",
      "answer": "Low pressure in George often comes from ageing galvanised pipes (common in older suburbs), municipal supply issues, or blocked supply lines. It can also indicate leaks in your system. A plumber can diagnose the cause — sometimes it's a simple fix like a faulty pressure reducing valve, other times it requires partial repiping. During peak summer, municipal pressure drops affect everyone."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which areas do George plumbers service?",
      "answer": "ProHub plumbers cover all George areas including the CBD, Blanco, Denneoord, Heatherlands, Pacaltsdorp, Thembalethu, Herolds Bay, Wilderness, and Victoria Bay. Many also service nearby towns like Sedgefield, Knysna, and Mossel Bay. Confirm coverage and any travel fees when requesting quotes."
